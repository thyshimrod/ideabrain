## **Why Change?**

I remember a time when I was juggling three projects at once. I was enthusiastic, energized, convinced that I could handle everything simultaneously. But after a few weeks, things began to unravel: I was doing a thousand things at once, yet nothing was truly moving forward, and I… I was escaping my frustration by launching new ideas—each more exciting than the last.  
It wasn’t courage, nor even creativity. It was an automatic response: a flight from the pain of failure, disguised as enthusiasm.

That day, I realized that what I thought was my freedom was actually a gilded cage. My enthusiasm, my creativity—those qualities that led me into constant dispersion and that I believed were my strengths—were actually sabotaging what mattered most to me: depth, trust, stability. And it was by allowing myself to sit with my discomfort, instead of running toward the next distraction, that I discovered a quieter, truer kind of joy.

## **The Trap of Automatic Patterns**

Our automatisms are first and foremost protections.  
They helped us survive, adapt, and avoid pain.  
But over time, as we react mechanically, we eventually exhaust ourselves.

- The perfectionist corrects until exhaustion.
    
- The helper gives endlessly… and wears out from not receiving.
    
- The achiever stacks up successes… yet no longer knows who they are behind the mask.
    
- The enthusiast multiplies experiences… and can no longer bear silence.
    

As long as we remain identified with these mechanisms, we believe we “are like this”—and that is where personality tests can become dangerous. They reinforce these identities. We justify our reactions because something “confirms” that this is who we are.  
But the truth is: we are not our automatisms. They are only a protective layer, an old piece of software.

---

## **Why Make the Effort to Change?**

The question is legitimate: why embark on a path that is sometimes uncomfortable? Why face what we’ve spent years avoiding?  
It is always more comfortable to stay in what we know—even if it is far from ideal.

Remaining in automatism has a cost:

- The cost of relationships damaged by disproportionate reactions.
    
- The cost of projects sabotaged by our avoidance or rigidity.
    
- The cost of a fragile joy, dependent on circumstances.
    

By contrast, choosing to grow brings concrete benefits:

- Less self-sabotage in our lives.
    
- More inner freedom when confronted with triggers.
    
- More authentic relationships, less conditioned by our fears.
    
- And above all: a more grounded joy, less dependent on the external world.
    

I would never have been able to complete this book if I had stayed stuck in my Type 7 compulsions. Staying focused on a single project means fearing that I’m missing out on other opportunities. It’s also a form of self-sabotage that keeps me from achieving what truly matters most to me, when I look deeply.

Changing doesn’t mean becoming someone else. It means rediscovering who we were before the ego’s armor took over.

---

## **The Paradox of the Ego**

The ego is not “bad.” It is a survival strategy.  
It was built to protect us from a fundamental fear: abandonment, failure, rejection, weakness… whatever it may be. But what once saved us often becomes our prison today.

The progression described by the Enneagram is not a battle against the ego. It is a path toward observing it, understanding it, and gradually no longer confusing it with our deeper self. Our deeper self longs to live a fulfilled life; yet the ego, in its desire to protect us, often prevents that fulfillment because it is so focused on keeping us safe.

---

## **A Hope for Transcendence**

Here lies the hope: our automatisms are not fate.  
They are signals, entry points.  
Recognizing them is the first step toward transforming them into choices.  
And behind those choices lies the possibility of a life less endured and more consciously lived.

Where I once believed I needed to run ever faster, I discovered the power of slowing down.  
Where some believe they must control everything, they discover the peace of letting go.  
Where others think they must constantly charm, they discover the joy of being loved simply for who they are.

It’s not an easy path, but it is a liberating one.

---

## **Practical Exercise**

Take a moment and write down:

1. Three recurring frustrations from your recent life (e.g., a conflict, procrastination, an escape).
    
2. For each one, ask yourself: _Why did I avoid or react this way?_
    
3. Observe without judgment. The goal isn’t to fix anything—only to see.
    

This simple exercise is a first step: turning what seemed “normal” into an object of awareness.

Changing is not a moral obligation nor a performance goal.  
It is an invitation to live with less constraint and more presence.  
It is the shift from automatism to consciousness.

In the next section, we’ll explore how this process begins: learning to take a step back, adopting a meta-view of our behaviors, and recognizing our patterns without identifying with them.

---

# **Gaining Perspective: The Meta-View**

Change always begins with one fundamental movement: _seeing._  
As long as we are glued to our reactions, they seem normal, inevitable—“it’s just how I am.”  
Progress becomes possible when we manage to take a step back, to observe our behaviors as if watching a movie.

---

## **Discovering That Other Logics Exist**

The first encounter with the Enneagram—or any tool for self-knowledge—is often a revelation. We come to understand that our reactions are not universal. What feels “obvious” to me is not obvious for others.

A Type 7 escapes discomfort through distraction.  
A Type 1 faces discomfort through discipline.  
A Type 9 dissolves into harmony to avoid conflict.

Seeing these differences creates a shift:  
_“Ah… so what I do is not a destiny—it’s a strategy.”_

---

## **From Inside to Outside: The Side Step**

The meta-view is this side step.  
It’s the ability to say:

- “Oh, I’m trying to please at all costs right now.”
    
- “Oh, I’m starting yet another project without finishing the previous one.”
    
- “Oh, I’m correcting a detail that doesn’t really matter.”
    

This isn’t deep transformation yet, but it’s the beginning of distance.  
Instead of being inside the reaction, you can begin to _see_ it.  
And this little space—between action and observation—is the crack through which awareness enters.

---

## **Confronting the Shadow Zones**

Of course, this step back isn’t always comfortable.  
Observing our patterns also means seeing what we preferred to ignore: fear, dependency, rigidity, avoidance.  
It means meeting our shadow.

A personal example: one day in a work meeting, I realized I was nodding in agreement… even though I disagreed.  
I wanted to avoid conflict, preserve harmony—but I was betraying myself.  
In that moment, I felt shame and discomfort.  
But that awareness planted a seed: I began noticing that avoidance mechanism appearing in other situations.

This moment of clarity isn’t pleasant, but it’s precious.  
Because as long as we haven’t named our patterns, they govern us silently.

---

## **A Shift in Perspective**

Taking the meta-view is like shifting from actor to spectator of your own life.  
The action continues, but the inner observer awakens.

Instead of saying, “I’m like this,” we can say, “I see that I’m doing this.”  
A small nuance in appearance—yet in reality, enormous.  
It is the shift from _I am_ to _I observe._

---

# **Shedding Light on the Invisible**

Observing your reactions is progress.  
But often, what we see on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg.  
Behind our automatisms lie deeper motivations—fears and desires working behind the scenes.  
This is the “invisible” we are now going to illuminate.

---

## **Automatism: A Survival Strategy**

Every automatic pattern has a logic:  
It protected us once.

- The perfectionist (Type 1) corrected to avoid criticism.
    
- The helper (Type 2) made themselves indispensable to feel loved.
    
- The achiever (Type 3) performed to avoid rejection.
    

These strategies worked—they were vital in childhood.  
But in adulthood, they become rigid, mechanical, outdated.  
They respond to a past that no longer exists.

---

## **The Ego as a Filter**

The ego works like an invisible pair of glasses.  
It colors reality according to its core fear:

- Type 1 sees imperfection everywhere.
    
- Type 6 sees potential threats everywhere.
    
- Type 7 sees opportunities to escape boredom everywhere.
    

This filter doesn’t feel like a filter—it feels like _the truth._  
That is what makes it so hard to notice.

Lighting up the invisible means acknowledging that what seems objectively true is often just a projection of the ego.

---

## **Pain and Suffering: Two Different Realities**

A key teaching is distinguishing between pain and suffering.

- **Pain** is inevitable: loss, separation, failure.
    
- **Suffering** arises from our automatic resistance to pain.
    

Example: a project fails.  
Pain is the disappointment.  
Suffering is the story we tell ourselves:  
“I’m useless, this always happens, I must start something new quickly to forget.”

The automatic pattern turns a limited event into a spiral of suffering.

Becoming aware of this mechanism already weakens its power.

---

## **A Moment of Truth**

I remember a day, after a heated meeting, when a wave of anger rose in me.  
My reflex would have been to send a sharp email, to regain control.  
But by pausing for a moment, I saw something else: my fear of being humiliated.  
Behind my anger was a vulnerability I didn’t want to feel.

That clarity changed my response: instead of attacking, I calmly named my feelings.  
The situation softened.  
It wasn’t easy—but it was the first time I felt the freedom of a real choice.

---

# **Experimenting and Understanding the “Why”**

Observing automatisms is progress.  
But if we stop there, we risk becoming powerless spectators of our own reactions.  
The next step is daring to experiment and exploring the deeper meaning of our compulsions.

---

## **Breaking the Auto-Pilot Through Experience**

Awareness doesn’t grow only through reflection.  
It grows through experience.

Practically, this means choosing—just once—to do something different.

- The perfectionist leaves a small imperfection on purpose.
    
- The helper dares to say no and observes the reaction.
    
- The achiever openly shares a failure instead of hiding it.
    
- The enthusiast stays with boredom instead of fleeing into a new distraction.
    

These modest but concrete experiments create a crack in the compulsion.  
They open a space where a new behavior becomes possible.

---

## **Returning to the “Why”**

Every compulsion has a story.  
It once protected something fragile in us:

- The need to be loved.
    
- The need to be recognized.
    
- The need to feel safe.
    

In childhood, these automatisms were intelligent—they helped us adapt.  
But in adulthood, they become rigid, inappropriate, even harmful.

Understanding this “why”—this root need—is not about blaming parents or the past, but about recognizing that our pattern makes sense.  
And because the need is legitimate, we can find more conscious ways to meet it.

---

## **Healing Rather Than Dampening**

Many personal development approaches focus on mitigation:  
managing stress, breathing to calm anger, planning to avoid procrastination.  
Useful… but not transformative.

Real healing occurs when we recognize the root fear and face it.  
When we stop running and discover that the fear no longer holds the power it once had over the child we were.

Mitigation repairs the surface temporarily; healing frees us deeply.

---

## **Anecdote: Staying With Discomfort**

I recall an evening when I wanted to dive into a new project, knowing it was an escape.  
I decided to sit still, without opening my computer.  
At first, it was unbearable—agitation, the urge to fill the void.  
Then, after a while, something softened.  
I felt the sadness behind my automatisms, and I was able to experience it without drowning in it.

That moment was a turning point:  
I understood that behind the agitation was simply an emotion I didn’t want to meet.

---

## **Practical Exercise**

1. Choose one recurring automatic pattern (perfectionism, avoidance, seduction, control, etc.).
    
2. For one week, decide to suspend it just once per day:
    
    - Leaving a task unfinished.
        
    - Saying “no” to a request.
        
    - Not launching a new idea.
        
3. Observe what it triggers in you: fear, anger, sadness, emptiness.
    
4. Write in your journal:  
    **“This automatism serves to… but today I can also…”**
    

This exercise connects observation to meaning—and meaning to new freedom.

Experimenting and understanding the why unites two movements:  
action and depth.  
One without the other is incomplete.  
Experience without meaning remains superficial.  
Meaning without experience remains theoretical.  
Together, they open the door to real transformation.

In the next section, we’ll see how these insights and experiments weave into a daily life that becomes less automatic, where inner freedom gradually becomes a habit.

---

# **A Less Automatic Life**

By this stage, you’ve understood the logic of automatisms, learned to observe them, begun revealing the invisible, and experimented with new ways of acting.  
One essential question remains:  
How do you make this awareness part of everyday life?  
How do you turn occasional insights into a durable way of living?

---

## **From Insight to Integration**

A moment of clarity can change a reaction, but it’s not enough to change a life.  
Automatisms will return—inevitably.  
They are old, deep, wired into our reflexes.

The goal isn’t to “eliminate them once and for all,” but to build a habit of awareness.

Like physical training, progress comes through repetition.  
By observing, naming, experimenting again and again, the space of freedom expands.  
Where yesterday we reacted without choice, today we begin to feel the wave coming… and decide how to surf it.

---

## **Three Concrete Benefits**

When awareness becomes a practice, three major changes unfold:

1. **Less self-sabotage:** conflicts, scatter, and rigidity decrease.
    
2. **More authentic relationships:** by recognizing our fears and strategies, we become clearer, more honest, more available to others.
    
3. **A more stable joy:** no longer fleeting excitement or unreachable perfection, but a quieter presence less dependent on circumstances.
    

These benefits do not appear overnight.  
They settle gradually—like a silent transformation.

---

## **Missteps Are Part of the Journey**

It’s important to remember that this process is not linear.  
There will be relapses, setbacks, moments when old patterns resurface.  
This is normal.

The key is not to judge these moments, but to see them as invitations to begin again.  
Every moment of awareness—even after a “regression”—expands your freedom a little more.

---

## **Projection Exercise**

Take a few minutes and imagine:

- If one year from now your automatisms had 20% less control over your life, what would be different?
    
- Which relationships would feel easier?
    
- Which projects would be more solid?
    
- What inner weight would be lighter?
    

Write down your answers.  
This simple exercise gives a clear direction to your progress:  
not impossible perfection, but tangible, realistic, motivating change.

---

## **A Living Practice**

Living less under the rule of automatisms is not a static state.  
It is a living, breathing practice.  
Each day, each interaction is an opportunity to see, to choose, to practice.

With time, awareness becomes like a muscle:  
the more it is used, the stronger it grows.

---

## **Chapter Conclusion**

Moving from automatism to awareness is not a promise of perfection.  
It is an invitation to live more freely, more consciously, more authentically.  
It marks the beginning of an inner transformation that also reshapes how we relate to the world.
