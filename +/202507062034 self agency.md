**10 Days to Agency: seeing through the illusion of fear and the story of procrastination.** Hosted by [Julian Jacome](mailto:julian.jacome@proton.me) and [Eliza Cavanaugh](mailto:eliza.cavanaugh@gmail.com). Through the use of tools such as effective self-talk that works with your neurology, exploring childhood trauma and fears, and an understanding of underlying beliefs that prevent one from taking action, this simple program is designed for individuals who feel they could benefit from a little more agency in their lives. It should also be interesting to those who would like another tool for working with shadow material, particularly in relation to fear. If you are new to the party and would like to join us, you can download the self-guided tool here: [Self Discipline In 10 Days.pdf](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1AvW7qtbSPPHuml2xxv2KIZ9T5pHbV0Vd&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2cvlDH8VRTp_D0nHnM24ov)


To summarize the PDF "Self-Discipline in 10 Days" by Theodore Bryant using Prompt 21 from the provided context file, I will apply the **Argument Extraction with Agency and Norms Focus** prompt. This involves extracting main arguments, performing a full argument extraction with sub-arguments, and conducting a Toulmin analysis, focusing on agency, norms versus innovation, and causal links. The response will be in Markdown, under 3000 words, with a clear, professional tone.

## Full Argument Extraction 

1. **Self-discipline is a learnable skill, not an innate trait (Theodore Bryant).**
    
    - 1.1. Self-discipline is not a personality trait or forcing oneself with willpower (Bryant).
    - 1.2. It involves coordinating conscious and subconscious psychological elements (Bryant).
    - 1.3. Anyone can learn self-discipline through practice, like a muscle (Bryant).
        - 1.3.1. Regular practice strengthens self-discipline (Bryant).
        - 1.3.2. Lack of practice leads to atrophy, hindering self-discipline (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Theodore Bryant, as the author and expert, drives this argument by presenting self-discipline as a skill accessible to all, challenging the norm that it’s an innate quality. This is innovative, as it democratizes self-discipline, shifting from a fixed trait to a developable process. The causal link is that viewing self-discipline as learnable empowers individuals to take action, leading to improved outcomes in personal goals.
    
2. - 2.1. Fear of failure links failure to humiliation, reducing commitment (Individuals).
        
        - 2.1.1. Society trains egos to associate failure with shame (Society/Individuals).
            
        - 2.1.2. Failure should be seen as a stepping stone, not a tombstone (Bryant).
            
        - 2.2. Fear of success stems from guilt or pressure to maintain success (Individuals).
            
            - 2.2.1. Success can lead to loneliness or resentment from others (Individuals).
        - 2.3. Fear of rejection drives approval-seeking, undermining personal goals (Individuals).
            
            - 2.3.1. Inability to say “No” prioritizes others over self (Individuals).
        - 2.4. Fear of mediocrity fuels perfectionism, causing procrastination (Individuals).
            
            - 2.4.1. ==Perfectionism is a subconscious fear of appearing mediocre (Bryant).==
        - 2.5. Fear of risks prioritizes safety, limiting action (Individuals).
            
            - 2.5.1. Risks are opportunities, not dangers, when reframed (Bryant).
        
        **Reasoning Note**: Individuals are the primary agents, as these fears operate within their subconscious. The argument perpetuates the norm that fears are natural but innovates by urging conscious confrontation, a novel approach to self-discipline. Addressing fears causally leads to reduced resistance and increased action toward goals.
        
    
3. **Hyde, the inner childlike rebel, sabotages self-discipline efforts (Hyde/Individuals).**
    
    - 3.1. Hyde uses cynicism, negativism, defeatism, escapism, and delayism (Hyde).
        - 3.1.1. Cynicism questions the value of self-discipline efforts (Hyde).
        - 3.1.2. Negativism focuses on negative outcomes (Hyde).

        - 3.1.5. Delayism postpones action with excuses (Hyde).
    - 3.2. Hyde should be a partner, not an enemy, to align with self-discipline (Bryant).
        - 3.2.1. Personalizing Hyde fosters cooperation (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Hyde, a metaphorical agent within individuals, drives resistance, perpetuating the norm of internal conflict. Bryant’s innovative approach is to recruit Hyde as a partner, reducing inner conflict and causally enhancing self-discipline by aligning subconscious desires with conscious goals.
    
4. **Action-oriented self-talk counters self-defeating thoughts (Individuals).**
    
    - 4.1. Self-talk must be positive, specific, and present tense (Bryant).
        - 4.1.1. Subconscious believes what it’s told, shaping behavior (Bryant).
    - 4.2. Repetition strengthens self-talk’s impact (Bryant).
    - 4.3. Verbalizing self-talk aloud enhances its power (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Individuals drive this argument by consciously using self-talk to override Hyde’s negative influence. This innovates by replacing passive self-defeat with active self-empowerment, causally improving motivation and action toward goals.

6. **Reward systems motivate action and sustain self-discipline (Individuals).**
    
    - 6.1. Private praise reinforces small steps (Bryant).
    - 6.2. Written contracts with rewards enhance commitment (Bryant).
    - 6.3. Gradual steps make tasks manageable, with rewards for each (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Individuals implement reward systems, innovating by leveraging personal pleasures to motivate action, countering the norm of relying on willpower. This causally sustains effort and completion of goals.
    
7. **Vitaminds (affirmations) reinforce goals and self-discipline (Individuals).**
    
    - 7.1. Vitaminds are positive, specific, present-tense affirmations (Bryant).
        - 7.1.1. Written in first, second, and third person for impact (Bryant).
    - 7.2. Placed visibly, they counter negative thoughts (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Individuals use Vitaminds to reprogram subconscious beliefs, innovating by making affirmations a daily tool. This causally strengthens goal focus and self-discipline.

    - 9.1. Goal sheets include specific goals, steps, and timeframes (Bryant).
    - 9.2. They clarify commitment and potential drawbacks (Bryant).
    
    **Reasoning Note**: Individuals create goal sheets, innovating by turning vague dreams into structured plans, countering the norm of unfulfilled aspirations. This causally improves focus and progress.
    
10. **Self-discipline is a process with distinct stages: Decision, Preparation, Action, Completion/Maintenance (Theodore Bryant/Individuals).**
    
    - 10.1. Decision stage involves choosing and solidifying a goal (Individuals).
        - 10.1.1. Weighing benefits versus drawbacks clarifies commitment (Bryant).
    - 10.2. Preparation stage breaks tasks into small steps (Individuals).
