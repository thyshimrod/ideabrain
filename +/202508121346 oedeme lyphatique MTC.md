📜 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Interpretation  
In TCM, chronic edema with water retention in the legs, present for decades, is often seen as a sign of a deep internal imbalance that prevents water and fluids from circulating freely.  
The location (calves/legs), the chronic nature (30 years), and the yin quality of the stagnation (accumulation, heaviness) often point to a weakness of the Spleen and Kidneys, sometimes with Liver involvement.

### 1. Possible Imbalance: Weak Spleen (Pi)  
**Role in TCM:** The Spleen transforms food and drink into energy (Qi) and useful fluids, then distributes them. It “keeps fluids in their proper place.”  

**If weak:**  

- Difficulty raising clear Qi → heaviness in the legs  
- Dampness stagnation → edema, swollen calves sensation  

**Common causes:** long-term cold or damp diet (dairy, sugar, excess raw foods), mental overwork, sedentary lifestyle.

---

### 2. Possible Imbalance: Weak Kidneys (Shèn)  
**Role in TCM:** Govern water throughout the body, especially the “evaporation” and circulation of fluids.  

**If weak:**  

- Water stagnates in the lower body (legs, ankles)  
- Reduced ability to drain upward  

**Common causes:** natural aging, past illnesses, long-term cold exposure, chronic exhaustion.

### 3. Liver (Gan) and Qi Stagnation  
**Role in TCM:** Regulates the smooth flow of Qi and thus also fluids.  

**If blocked:**  

- Stagnation → slowed lymphatic circulation  
- Can be worsened by stress or repressed emotions  

**Link with Spleen/Kidneys:** If the Liver is tense, it attacks the Spleen, worsening dampness.

🔍 **TCM Synthesis**  
A chronic lymphatic edema like the one you describe could be explained by **Spleen Qi deficiency combined with Kidney Yang deficiency**, with dampness accumulating in the lower body.  
**Metaphor:** The “cooking fire” (Spleen/Kidneys) is too weak, so water stagnates at the bottom instead of evaporating and circulating.

🎯 **TCM Root-Cause Approaches** *(to complement what you are already doing)*  
*(To be discussed with a qualified TCM practitioner before applying)*  

#### 1. Support the Spleen  
- Warm, cooked diet: soups, broths, steamed vegetables, gluten-free grains  
- Reduce cold/damp foods: dairy, raw vegetables, iced drinks, refined sugars  
- Small, regular meals instead of large spaced-out ones  

#### 2. Tonify Kidney Yang  
- Avoid prolonged cold exposure (feet and lower back)  
- Introduce warming foods: cinnamon, ginger, garlic, leek  
- Gentle but regular activity (as you are already doing with walking and swimming)  

#### 3. Activate Qi and Fluid Circulation  
- Self-massage or moxibustion on key points: [ST36 (ZuSanLi), KI3 (TaiXi), SP6 (SanYinJiao)](<[[https://www.chrysalide-eveil.fr/bien-etre/medecine-chinoise/point-acupuncture-digiponcture-meridien-estomac-e36/|E36 ZuSanLi]] ou [[https://www.acupression.fr/point-acupression-trois-lieues/|E36 ZuSanLi]], [[https://tuinasimo.com/meridiens-points-acupuncture/meridien-rein/taixi-3rn/|R3 TaiXi]], [[https://www.mastertungacupuncture.org/acupuncture/traditional/points/sp6|SP6 SanYinJiao]]>)  
- Gentle daily stretches  
- Energy practices (Qi Gong or Tai Chi)

💡 **In TCM logic**, treating only the symptom (drainage) without nourishing the Spleen and warming the Kidneys may keep the problem in place.  
The ideal approach would combine:  

- **Physical drainage** (as you are already doing)  
- **Internal strengthening** (nutrition + energetic stimulation)  
- **Emotional release** if the Liver is involved
