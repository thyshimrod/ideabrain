* When you feel fear, go ahead anyway, without letting it hold you back.You can have your fear, just don’t let it stop you.
* Find security within yourself—within your own body—free of contractions that come from anxiety.
* Pay attention to your inner reality and remain rooted in the present moment without replaying past hurts.
* Take in positive feedback from people who affirm your strength and stability. 
* Reclaim your inner power and authority. 
* Adopt a meditation practice to learn how to let go of problematic fearbased thoughts.
* Talk through your anxieties in a therapeutic setting as a way of facing them and getting (evidence-based) reality checks. Then let them go. 
* Take on specific new challenges from a position of strength, trust, and confidence. Notice (and remember) when things turn out well because you applied your own power and strength to the situation.
