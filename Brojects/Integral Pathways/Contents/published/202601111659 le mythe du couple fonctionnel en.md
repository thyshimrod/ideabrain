# The Myth of the Functional Couple:

## Why a Well-Organized Relationship Can Still Die

After deconstructing the myth of compatibility, then that of effort and help as solutions to exhaustion, one final refuge remains—particularly seductive for "mature," conscious, educated, well-intentioned couples.

This refuge is the following idea:

> _"If our relationship works well, if we communicate properly, if we've solved organizational and workload issues... then everything will be fine."_

This is false.  
Or more precisely: **it's not enough**.

Many couples today are neither toxic, nor conflictual, nor dysfunctional in the classic sense.  
They are **functional**.  
And yet, something slowly fades away.

Not an explosion.  
Not a spectacular crisis.  
But an **erosion of the living**.

## When the Relationship Becomes an Optimized System

The first two articles already invited us to leave behind a naive vision of the couple:

- first by moving away from the projective logic of compatibility,
- then by abandoning the sacrificial morality of help and effort.

But there exists a third impasse, more subtle, often confused with a form of relational maturity:  
**the transformation of the couple into an optimized system.**

At this stage, many things are going "well":

- tasks are distributed,
- conflicts are regulated,
- needs are expressed,
- decisions are made rationally.

The couple becomes an **efficient mechanism**.  
And this is precisely where the danger begins.

Because a human relationship is not a system whose purpose is to function.  
It is a **space where life is put into play**.

## The Invisible Shift: From Energy to Desire

In the second article, we shifted the question from conflict to energy:  
who carries what, how the system becomes exhausted, how to redesign it.

But once energy is restored, a more radical question appears:

> _Why invest this energy here?_

This is a question many couples carefully avoid.  
Not from lack of intelligence, but because it is **ontologically destabilizing**.

Because it no longer concerns:

- what is fair,
- what is equitable,
- what is reasonable,

but rather:

- **what is desired**,
- **what has meaning**,
- **what deserves to be risked**.

Yet desire is not an organizational problem.  
And meaning cannot be decreed by consensus.

## Desire ≠ Need ≠ Security

A major confusion runs through contemporary discourse on couples:  
the confusion between **desire**, **need**, and **security**.

- **Needs** relate to psychic and emotional survival.
- **Security** relates to system stabilization.
- **Desire** relates to the movement of life itself.

Desire does not obey the logic of optimization.  
It does not answer the question: _"Is this reasonable?"_  
But another, far more unsettling one:  
_"Is something alive still circulating here?"_

A couple can be:

- secure,
- well-organized,
- energetically balanced,

and yet be **disaffected**, in the literal sense:  
disconnected from affect, from thrill, from momentum, from risk.

## The Couple as Instrument: A Modern Drift

Many modern couples no longer ask of the relationship:

> _"What do we want to live together?"_

They ask:

> _"What is it for?"_

- to be less alone,
- to be more stable,
- to better manage life,
- to be psychologically healthier.

The couple then becomes a **personal regulation tool**.

But when a relationship is instrumentalized—even with good intentions—it ceases to be a place of encounter between two living subjectivities.  
It becomes a **means** serving an external end.

And this shift has a cost:  
desire does not long survive instrumentalization.

## The Central Paradox: We Don't Choose Desire, But We Choose to Listen to It

Here's a crucial point, often misunderstood:

Desire cannot be commanded.  
But **listening to desire is a choice**.

Many couples prefer:

- continuity,
- coherence,
- stability,

to the discomfort of a question like:

> _"Are we still aligned with what deeply drives us?"_

This is not cowardice.  
It's a protection strategy.

But in the long term, this protection becomes a **sterilization of the living**.

## From a Couple "That Works" to a Couple "That Has a Direction"

What distinguishes a living couple from a merely functional one is not the absence of problems.  
It's the existence of a **shared direction**, even if shifting, even if uncertain.

A direction that doesn't simply come down to:

- paying bills,
- raising children,
- maintaining balance.

But that poses a broader question:

> _"What world do we want to help create together, even on a small scale?"_

At this level, the relationship ceases to be only a space for repair or support.  
It becomes a **place of meaning**.
