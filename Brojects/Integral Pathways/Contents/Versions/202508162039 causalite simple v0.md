# Why Your Brain Craves Simplicity – And How It's Holding You Back

related: - "[[why-brain-prefers-simplicity-Korenote]]"

# The Illusion of the Easy Answer

I stared at my failed garden, wilted plants mocking my efforts.

Watered daily, as "everyone knows" that's what makes them strong.

Frustration boiled up.

Why didn't it work?

I blamed the weather.

The soil.

Bad luck.

Then it hit me.

My brain's love for simple answers was the real culprit.

A cozy trap.

Comfortable.

Deadly.

# The Seductive Lie of Simplicity

You’ve been there.

A quick fix crumbles.

You pour in effort.

Lose weight: eat less, move more.

Build a business: follow the "proven" plan.

Inspire a team: just motivate harder.

It flops.

You point fingers.

"They weren't ready."

"Wrong timing."

But deep down, it's _you_.

Not your hustle.

Your lens.

Society peddles a ridiculous myth.

_One cause, one cure._

Catch a cold? Wet hair outside.

Tired? Not enough sleep.

Absurd, yet we cling to it.

Ignore the layers: stress, immunity, emotions.

Failure ensues.

With a naive shrug.

Flat thinking is a soft prison.

Cozy.

Confining.

You chase shortcuts.

Bypassing chaos.

It pins you.

_What if those "easy" answers are invitations to deeper truth?_

# The Hidden Strength in Complexity

What if your brain's simplicity bias isn't a flaw?

What if it's a relic?

A survival hack gone wrong.

I saw my frustration as weakness.

A mental glitch blocking progress.

Then I studied those who thrive.

Kahneman's System 1: fast, energy-saving, but blind to nuance.

Taleb's antifragile: chaos builds strength.

Wilber's AQAL: map reality in quadrants, not lines.

Their power? Rejecting single-cause fairy tales.

Embracing multifaceted mess.

Failure isn't doom.

It's data.

_Your biases are ancient tools – upgrade them._

I learned in a health flop.

Strict diet, intense workouts: "eat less, move more."

Crashed hard.

Energy tanked, cravings raged.

Ruminating, I saw the truth.

Ignored mental (nutrients), body (balanced exercise), shadow (humiliation wound).

Recartographed with AQAL.

Nuanced nutrition, moderate cardio plus strength, therapy on shame.

Balance clicked.

Weight dropped, energy soared.

Failure was my guide.

Taleb nails it, with biting wit:

_The wind extinguishes a candle,_  
_but fuels a fire._  
_Your failures are that wind._  
_Ignite your blaze._

# The Cost of Clinging to Simplicity

Simplicity steals your wins.

It shrinks problems to one cause.

Slaps on mismatched fixes.

They collapse.

You feel it.

Anxiety from unsolved riddles.

Regret over wasted shots.

Every glossed-over layer seeds more pain.

I've watched teams tank on "best practices."

Orange consultant pushes KPIs in blue-rule culture.

Clash inevitable.

Blames their "rigidity."

But it's his flat view ignoring collective values.

No alignment, no advance.

Spiral Dynamics explains.

Blue craves structure; green seeks purpose.

Skip the base, chaos reigns.

Flat thinking isn't innocent.

It's a choice.

Victimhood in disguise.

Refusing complexity that unlocks real power.

_Simplicity soothes – at the price of your potential._

# A Living Revolution

Picture a different road.

Failure no wall.

A lever.

Call to real results.

This is the _Living Revolution_.

No flat mirages.

No lazy excuses.

Strategize boldly.

Align values.

Weave measurable moves.

I flipped after a flop forcing rumination.

Stopped blaming, faced my shortcuts.

Analyzed blue values, wove in chaos for hybrid tests.

Outcome imperfect, but real – aligned team, visible gains.

Taught me complexity isn't foe.

Tool for lasting triumphs.

You can too.

_Uncertainty isn't blind mess; your strategic arena._

# How to Spark Your Revolution

No more abstract fluff.

You need strategy yielding tangible wins.

Grounded in reality, Spiral Dynamics balancing values and acts.

Pragmatic shift turning failures to measurable levers.

Four steps to forge victories, weaving complexity lightly.

1. **Obsess on Failure**

Pick recent setback – stalled project, missed goal.

Where lost control?

Spot overlooked priorities: individual fears/motives, collective values/rules.

Analysis rooted in Spiral Dynamics uncovers concrete pivots to results.

2. **Believe in Hidden Wins**

Fear complexity no more.

Harari proves: align acts to measurable goals, chaos turns strength.

Map values at play – blue needs structure before green purpose.

Pragmatic clarity, eye on unpredictable, flips failure to quick-win fuel.

3. **Weave Hybrid Strategy**

Build results-driven plan.

In blue culture, bolster processes before green ideals.

Test measurable acts – prototype, targeted meet – embracing chaos bits for adapt.

Like orange entrepreneur, chase quick victories, respecting values for lasting push.

Each iteration counts.

4. **Persuade and Iterate**

Share vision with colleague or journal.

Convince self failure's data, not defeat.

Act, measure impact, boldly adjust.

I relaunched project aligning team on clear KPIs, weaving collective feedback balancing structure, purpose.

Iterate till results roar.

# Your Success, Forged

Your _Living Revolution_ ignites now.

Every failure invites.

Every act weaves path.

I've been pinned by failed project haunting me.

Believed "proven" method sufficed, crashed spectacularly.

Shoulders tensed with self-doubt weight, replaying wrongs nightly.

By aligning actions to terrain values – blending blue structure, green purpose with adaptive chaos dash – unlocked concrete results.

Setbacks became truest guides, complexity harnessed key to unstoppable growth.

Transformed me from frustrated leader to resilient strategist.

Harari says best, irony jolting:

_Our choices shape our world._  
_The actions we take,_  
_define our reality._  
_Forge yours._

Stop awaiting perfect clarity – procrastinator's trap.

Grab one failure today.

Apply four steps.

Share revised plan.

In journal.

With colleague.

On X.

Do within three days.

Watch setbacks morph.

To vibrant, unstoppable success.

And chuckle at old, naive self.
