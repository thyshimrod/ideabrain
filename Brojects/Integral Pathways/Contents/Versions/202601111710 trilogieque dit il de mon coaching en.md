# What This Trilogy Says About My Coaching Approach

This trilogy is not an isolated editorial production.  
It is the condensed expression of my way of **thinking about accompaniment**, and especially of what I now refuse to do as a coach.

I don't coach to reassure.  
I don't coach to optimize systems that are already dead.  
I don't coach to help people better tolerate a life they haven't truly chosen.

If I wrote successively about compatibility, energy, then desire and meaning, it's not out of conceptual preference.  
It's because, in practice, **all serious coaching passes through these three thresholds**, whether individual, relational, or organizational.

## 1. Leaving Flat Thinking Behind: Coaching as Complexification Work

The first article attacks a fundamental point:  
the human—and institutional—tendency to seek simple explanations for complex realities.

In coaching, this translates into requests like:

- "Tell me what's wrong with me / with the other person"
- "Give us a tool that works"
- "Help us communicate better"

My work begins precisely **where these requests become insufficient**.

For me, coaching consists first of **uninstalling the belief that there exists a single cause, a ready-made solution, or a definitive good diagnosis**.  
Not to lose people in complexity, but to enable them to **move beyond reactivity**.

This is why I use frameworks like AQAL, systems dynamics, or developmental reading: not as explanatory grids, but as **de-simplification devices**.

Coaching begins when the person stops asking:

> "Who's wrong?"  
> and starts asking:  
> "What system am I participating in—and at what cost?"

## 2. Shifting the Problem: From Morality to Energetic Architecture

The second article marks an essential turn in my posture:  
I almost never work on "willpower," effort, or motivation.

Not out of indulgence, but because **most situations of exhaustion are not failures of will, but design flaws**.

In classical coaching, the functional ego is often reinforced:

- better saying no,
- better asserting oneself,
- better organizing oneself.

This can be useful in the short term.  
But in the long term, it often amounts to **strengthening someone so they can continue carrying a system that exhausts them**.

My approach instead consists of asking a structural question:

> "Why does this system—relational, professional, identity-based—consume so much energy?"

And especially:

> "Who really benefits from it remaining as it is?"

At this stage, coaching ceases to be psychological accompaniment and becomes **life architecture work**:

- architecture of roles,
- architecture of implicit expectations,
- architecture of invisible loyalties,
- architecture of environments.

I don't help people "hold on."  
I accompany them to **redesign what holds them**.

## 3. The Rarely Named Threshold: Desire, Direction, Meaning

The third article addresses what many coaching frameworks carefully avoid.

Once:

- the system is clearer,
- energy flows better,
- conflicts are less reactive,

there remains a question that neither psychology, nor organization, nor morality can settle:

> "Why continue here?"

This is when coaching becomes truly demanding—and ethically delicate.

Because I cannot promise that:

- desire will return,
- meaning will be rebuilt,
- the relationship or trajectory will be "saved."

My role is not to artificially maintain what functions technically but **no longer carries any life**.

I accompany people and collectives to **dare to look at what cannot be repaired through more effort or more awareness**, but only through an existential choice:

- re-engaging differently,
- transforming profoundly,
- or sometimes, accepting an ending.

## A Clear Posture: I Don't Coach to Reassure the Ego

This trilogy makes explicit a posture I increasingly assume clearly:

I don't coach to help people conform to a norm of relational, professional, or personal success.

I coach to:

- increase the capacity to think in complexity,
- exit survival systems disguised as maturity,
- distinguish what pertains to repair from what pertains to choice,
- and accept that certain transformations involve real loss.

It's an uncomfortable posture.  
It doesn't suit everyone.  
But it's consistent with an adult vision of human development.

## In Summary: What This Trilogy Makes Visible

- **Coaching is not help**, but work toward lucidity.
- **Awareness without systemic redesign exhausts**.
- **Efficiency without desire desiccates**.
- And **maturity without meaning becomes a sophisticated form of survival**.

If this trilogy resonates, it's probably not because it provides answers.  
It's because it **shifts the questions** to a place where it becomes impossible to cheat with oneself durably.
