# **Introduction**

Your Type Seven compulsions are not your destiny—they can be deprogrammed. Doing so transforms your escape patterns into unshakeable freedom; ignoring them is choosing perpetual self-sabotage.  
As a Type Seven, I long saw my compulsions as allies: the mental gluttony that pushed me to fill every moment with new ideas, the avoidance of pain that kept me wrapped in forced optimism, anything to stay away from the emptiness lurking beneath. But one day, during a relational crisis, everything shifted.

I was in a conversation with a partner, a moment that required intimacy and engagement. But instead of facing vulnerability—my fear of being trapped in limitation—I derailed the moment with a joke, reframing the tension as “nothing serious, let’s move on to something fun.”  
It wasn’t enthusiasm; it was compulsive sabotage—an automatic mechanism that prevented me from choosing myself, from taking care of myself. It echoed my childhood, where my mother imposed “safe” choices to avoid conflict, conditioning me to fill the void instead of inhabiting it.

That moment was a shock: my compulsions, forged in restriction, were keeping me trapped in a loop where I prioritized external attention at the cost of my real potential.

Why deprogram these compulsions now? Because this work is not a constraint—it is liberation, transforming reactivity into conscious choice instead of letting the ego run your life.  
For a Type Seven like us, this means shifting from an automatic life—where avoidance sabotages our aspirations—to an existence where we finally choose ourselves, free from self-neglect.  
This chapter is your guide to this deprogramming—let’s begin by understanding how these compulsions hold us back, so we can release them step by step.

# **Definition and Role of Compulsions in the Enneagram**

In the Enneagram, compulsions are not just habits or quirks; they are automatic, unconscious responses of the ego, forged to protect us from the core fear of our type—but over time, they become chains that sabotage our potential and keep us trapped in a reactive life.

For Type Seven, the primary compulsion—avoiding pain and limitation—appears as mental gluttony: overconsuming ideas, pleasures, or experiences to fill an inner emptiness. I long mistook this for pure creativity, but it was actually disguised sabotage.

Inspired by Hudson, who defines compulsions as the ego’s “fixations” that distort reality to avoid the root fear, these impulses are not random. They are ego overlays—beliefs and judgments that warp perception to preserve the illusion of safety, at the cost of authenticity.

For me, this definition came alive during a moment of crisis: confronted with relational failure, instead of facing the pain, my ego imposed positive reframing, turning sadness into “an opportunity for fun elsewhere”—a sabotage that isolated me without my noticing it.

The role of compulsions in the Enneagram is twofold:  
• they act as shields to survive the core fear—for Sevens, avoiding limitation experienced as imprisonment in suffering;  
• they also act as signals pointing toward deep healing, inviting us to transcend the ego rather than merely soothe it.

Cron, with his narrative lens, views compulsions as looping stories: for the Seven, it is the story of a childhood where aspirations were restricted, leading to an ego that flees through gluttony. But facing this pattern allows you to rewrite the narrative and transcend it, reintegrating the strengths of other types.

For Type Seven, this role is particularly hopeful: compulsions show where we are stuck in constant seeking, a sabotage that steals our real potential—but they are also an invitation to explore the “why” behind them, leading to healing that goes beyond symptom-management and transforms avoidance into conscious strength.

This role also supports collective connection: compulsions are not purely individual—they are intertwined with the world, inviting you to integrate your shadow to contribute authentically, avoiding the traps of superficial growth.

Compulsions are not always “negative”; they helped you survive. But without nuance, they can be idealized as “fun” by the Seven, masking their cost in sabotage. This prepares us for the next section, where we explore the specific compulsions of Type Seven—reminding you that deprogramming them is the beginning of real emancipation, where you finally choose yourself without running away.

# **Discovering the Compulsions of Type Seven**

For the Type Seven, compulsions are like invisible currents pulling us toward the illusion of freedom, yet silently chaining us to cycles of endless sabotage—an exploration that begins by confronting how these mechanisms, rooted in our fear of limitation, keep us from truly choosing ourselves.

The Seven’s core compulsion—avoiding suffering—manifests as mental gluttony: compulsive overconsumption of ideas, experiences, or pleasures to fill an inner void. This sabotage keeps us scattered and unfinished, as if making a real choice were a threat too big to face.

For me, this compulsion became clear during a phase of disguised burnout: instead of facing the frustration of a stagnant project, I jumped on a new “exciting” opportunity, reframing the failure as a “positive lesson,” when deep down it was sabotage to avoid confronting pain. It echoed my childhood, where maternal restrictions taught me to conform my choices to others to survive rejection.

Hudson’s perspective—compulsions as ego fixations used to avoid the core fear—reveals that the Seven’s avoidance is not innocent: it pushes us to multiply options to avoid grounding ourselves, sabotaging relationships and potential by keeping us in endless pursuit that hides deep self-neglect.

Chestnut refines this with subtypes:  
• **Self-Preservation Seven** avoids deprivation through compulsive planning of material safety—sabotage that leads to rigid routines and prevents choosing real needs.  
• **Social Seven** animates groups to mask loneliness—superficiality that sabotages authentic connection by aligning energy to collective expectations.  
• **Sexual Seven** flees routine through passionate pursuits—idealizing intensity at the cost of stable commitment, depending on others to fill the void.

This discovery also involves examining the systemic role of compulsions: they act as shields to survive the fear of insignificance, yet become sabotage when they dominate, trapping us in a loop where we prioritize external attention over inner fulfillment.

Cron adds a narrative layer: compulsions are looping stories. For the Seven, avoidance masks childhood restriction, creating an ego that reframes to survive. Facing this role allows rewriting the narrative toward a complete personality. For the Seven, this means recognizing that our apparent “joy” is often a sabotage to conform our choices to others—avoiding self-care. But discovering this is an invitation to explore the “why,” leading to deep healing and transforming compulsions into conscious allies.

For years, I let myself be carried by opportunities. It was always easier to see the positive in whatever I was doing rather than admit that sometimes it pulled me away from what truly mattered to me. “Making the best of things” could have been my motto.  
The first problem: I never asked myself what I truly wanted, what mattered. Everything that happened to me was reframed as joy. I saw good fortune everywhere, and my ingrained attitude told me to always see the bright side.

This bright side helped me overcome many things—but I now see it was also a way to flee pain. I never fought for anything that truly mattered to me. I always preferred to see change as opportunity, and what happened as “lucky.”

Today, I know that doing what matters to me matters—and it may require phases of discipline without fun. Living with that allows me to stay centered.

# **Deprogramming Exercises for Type Seven Compulsions**

Now that we’ve uncovered the Type Seven compulsions as invisible currents that pull us toward illusory freedom yet chain us to sabotage, it’s time to take action with deprogramming exercises—iterative, personalized tools to release these patterns, moving beyond superficial symptom-relief and into deep healing that liberates your potential.

Inspired by Hudson—who sees compulsions as ego fixations to be released through awareness and affirmation—these exercises are not rigid routines that restrict your enthusiasm. They are flexible, creative invitations to observe, analyze, and confront your compulsions: starting on the surface to build trust, moving into the middle to deprogram, and reaching the depths to transcend into a life where _you_ choose for yourself.

## **Exercise 1 – Observe Your Two Paths: Escape or Integration**

**Purpose:** Recognize when you drift away from yourself (disintegration toward Type One) and when you ground yourself (integration toward Type Five).  
**Duration:** 10–15 minutes daily.

**Steps:**

1. Reflect on your day. Note two moments:  
    • one when you felt rigid, demanding, impatient (disintegration)  
    • one when you felt calm, curious, grounded (integration)
    
2. For each moment, write:  
    • What I felt in my body  
    • What I was trying to avoid  
    • What changed in my breathing or inner tone
    
3. Read your notes without judgment. Simply notice the energy differences.
    

**What you’ll notice:**  
You’ll see that disintegration isn’t caused by “stress” or “mistakes,” but by a fear of losing freedom.  
And that integration arrives when you stop long enough to taste your own presence.

Integration is not slowing down—it is regaining the freedom to choose your direction.

---

## **Exercise 2 – Consciously Choose Your Energy for the Day**

**Purpose:** Shift from reflexive dispersion to a conscious inner orientation.  
**Duration:** 10 minutes in the morning.

**Steps:**

1. Before opening your phone, take your notebook.
    
2. Write:  
    • My current energy (tired, excited, scattered…)  
    • What I choose to amplify today (calm, depth, simple joy)
    
3. Close your eyes and picture yourself acting from that chosen quality.
    
4. Throughout the day, return to it whenever your mind starts running.
    

**What you’ll notice:**  
You’ll realize you can channel your enthusiasm instead of being overwhelmed by it.  
This transforms hyperactivity into inner direction—the mark of a mature Seven.

Joy is not found by adding more, but by choosing what matters.

---

## **Exercise 3 – Return to the Calm of the Five**

**Purpose:** Explore the Seven’s natural growth path toward Type Five—learning to savor depth instead of fearing it.  
**Duration:** 20 minutes.

**Steps:**

1. Sit in a quiet space. Breathe slowly.
    
2. Choose a topic that excites you (idea, project, reading).
    
3. For 5 minutes, observe your urge to speed up, expand, move on.
    
4. Then slow down deliberately. Stay with the same topic, but explore in silence:  
    • What happens if I stay?  
    • What do I discover when I stop trying to understand quickly?
    
5. Note what you feel in your body and mind.
    

**What you’ll notice:**  
You’ll taste the beauty of concentration—not as a constraint, but as a doorway into your own depth.  
You’ll see that the Five’s calm is not cold—it is rich, stable, nourishing in a way excitement never is.

Integration is the inner adventure Sevens often forget to explore.

---

## **Exercise 4 – Connect Your Paths in a Spiral of Growth**

**Purpose:** Visualize your evolution and understand how your cycles repeat so you can orient them consciously.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes.

**Steps:**

1. Draw a spiral starting from the center.  
    • The center: your calm, your axis  
    • Outer circles: moments when you scatter or rigidify
    
2. On each circle, write:  
    • What you feel in those moments (tension, euphoria, fatigue)  
    • What you are unconsciously seeking (escape, freedom, recognition)
    
3. Look at your spiral and draw a line back to the center:  
    • What brings me back there?  
    • What practices or people keep me connected to myself?
    
4. End with an intention:  
    **“I choose the growth that connects me, not the growth that scatters me.”**
    

**What you’ll notice:**  
You’ll see that your cycles have a logic—not a destiny.  
The spiral reminds you that growth happens through successive movements—each return to calm is a rise in awareness.

Growing is not rising above yourself—it is returning to your center at every turn.

# **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this chapter on the compulsions of Type Seven reminds us that these invisible currents are not inevitable enemies, but ego signals we can deprogram for a liberated life—one where you transform reactivity into conscious, fulfilling choice.

We’ve seen that compulsions—automatic responses forged to protect against the fear of limitation—play a dual role of survival and sabotage. But by confronting them through a five-step guide, you open the door to deep healing that goes beyond symptom-management toward real emancipation.

For me, this deprogramming was transformative: by releasing my compulsive avoidance, rooted in childhood restriction, I began choosing myself, taking care of myself instead of pleasing others—a shift that led to grounded joy rather than constant seeking.

This process invites collective connection: your compulsions are not isolated—they are intertwined with the world. Deprogramming the ego allows you to contribute authentically, avoiding the traps of superficial growth.  
And there is real hope here: by deprogramming these compulsions, you make the unconscious conscious—as Jung said—directing your life instead of enduring it, and transcending toward a complete personality where you reintegrate the strengths of all types.

Your type 7 compulsions are not your destiny – deprogramming them means transforming your flight into unshakable freedom, but ignoring them means choosing perpetual sabotage.

As a type 7, I long saw my compulsions as allies: this mental gluttony that pushed me to fill every moment with new ideas, this avoidance of pain that kept me in forced optimism, all to avoid the lurking emptiness. But one day, during a relational crisis, everything shifted.

I was in the middle of a discussion with a partner, a moment where intimacy demanded commitment, but instead of facing the vulnerability – this fear of being trapped in limitation – I diverted the conversation with a joke, reframing the tension as "nothing serious, let's move on to something fun."

It wasn't enthusiasm; it was compulsive sabotage, an automatic mechanism that prevented me from choosing myself, from taking care of myself, an echo of my childhood where my mother imposed "safe" choices to avoid conflicts, conditioning me to fill the emptiness rather than inhabit it.

This moment was a shock: my compulsions, forged by this restriction, kept me prisoner in a loop where I prioritized external attention at the expense of my real potential.

Why deprogram these compulsions now? Because these efforts are not a constraint; they are an emancipation, transforming your reactivity into conscious choices, instead of letting the ego direct your life.

For a type 7 like us, this means moving from an automatic life, where avoidance sabotages our aspirations, to an existence where we finally decide for ourselves, freed from self-neglect. This chapter is your guide for this deprogramming – let's start by understanding how these compulsions hold us back, to release them step by step.

### Definition and Role of Compulsions in the Enneagram

Compulsions in the Enneagram are not simple habits or whims; they are automatic and unconscious responses of the ego, forged to protect against the basic fear of each type, but which, over time, become chains that sabotage our potential and keep us prisoners of a reactive life.

For type 7, the main compulsion – avoidance of suffering and limitation – manifests as mental gluttony, a compulsive overconsumption of ideas, pleasures, or experiences to fill the inner emptiness, a mechanism I long took for pure creativity, but which was actually disguised sabotage.

Inspired by Hudson, who defines compulsions as the "fixations" of the ego that distort reality to avoid the root fear, these impulses are not random; they are superimpositions of the ego, these beliefs and judgments that alter perception to maintain the illusion of security, but at the cost of lost authenticity.

For me, this definition came to life during a moment of crisis: faced with a relational failure, instead of confronting the pain, my ego imposed a positive reframing, transforming sadness into "an opportunity for fun elsewhere," a sabotage that isolated me without me realizing it.

The role of compulsions in the Enneagram is dual: they serve as a shield to survive basic fears – for the 7, avoiding limitation perceived as imprisonment in suffering – but they also play the role of a signal for deep healing, inviting us to transcend the ego rather than attenuate it.

Cron, with his narrative approach, sees compulsions as a looped story: for the 7, it's the story of a childhood where aspirations were restricted, leading to an ego that flees through gluttony, but confronting this role allows rewriting the narrative for a transcendence where you reintegrate qualities from other types.

For type 7, this role is particularly full of hope: compulsions show us where we are stuck in a constant quest, a sabotage that deprives us of our real potential, but they are also a call to study the "why" for healing that goes beyond attenuation, transforming our avoidance into a conscious strength.

This role encourages collective reliance: compulsions are not individual, but interconnected with the world, where you integrate your shadows to contribute authentically, avoiding the pitfalls of superficial growth.

Compulsions are not always "negative"; they serve to survive, but without nuance, they can be idealized as "fun" for the 7, masking their cost in sabotages. This role prepares us for the discovery of the specific compulsions of the 7 in the next section, reminding us that deprogramming these compulsions is the beginning of real emancipation, where you finally decide for yourself without fleeing.

### Discovery of the Compulsions of Type 7

For type 7, compulsions are like invisible currents that draw us toward the illusion of freedom, but deep down, chain us to a perpetual cycle of sabotage – a discovery that begins by confronting how these mechanisms, rooted in our fear of limitation, prevent us from truly choosing ourselves.

The main compulsion of the 7, avoidance of suffering, manifests as mental gluttony: a compulsive overconsumption of ideas, experiences, or pleasures to fill the inner emptiness, a sabotage that keeps us scattered and unfinished, as if deciding for oneself were an insurmountable threat.

For me, this compulsion revealed itself during a disguised burnout phase: instead of confronting the frustration of a stagnant project, I jumped on a new "exciting" opportunity, reframing the failure as a "positive lesson," but deep down, it was a sabotage to avoid diving into the pain, an echo of my childhood where maternal restrictions had taught me to conform my choices to others to survive rejection.

Inspired by Hudson, who sees compulsions as the "fixations" of the ego to avoid the root fear, this discovery shows us that the avoidance of the 7 is not innocent: it pushes us to multiply options so as not to anchor ourselves, sabotaging our relationships and potential by keeping us in a constant quest that masks deep self-neglect.

Chestnut nuances this with subtypes: a 7 self-preservation avoids deprivation by compulsively planning material securities, a sabotage that isolates them in a rigid routine but which, if not confronted, prevents deciding for their true needs; a 7 social animates groups to mask isolation, a compulsion to superficiality that sabotages authentic connections by conforming energy to collective expectations; a 7 sexual flees routine through a passionate quest, a sabotage that idealizes intensity at the expense of stable commitment, leaving them dependent on others to fill their emptiness.

This discovery of the compulsions of type 7 also involves an exploration of their systemic role: they serve as a shield to survive the fear of insignificance, but become sabotages when they dominate, trapping us in a loop where we prioritize external attention at the expense of our inner realization.

Cron adds a narrative layer: compulsions are looped stories, where for the 7, avoidance masks a childhood trauma of restriction, leading to an ego that reframes to survive, but confronting this role allows rewriting the narrative for a complete personality. For the 7, this means that our apparent "joy" is often a sabotage to conform our choices to others, avoiding taking care of ourselves, but the discovery of this role is a call to study the "why" for healing that goes beyond attenuation, transforming our compulsions into conscious allies.

For a long time, I let myself be carried by opportunities. It has always been easier for me to see the positive in everything I did, rather than seeing that sometimes it distanced me from my true aspiration. Making the best of a bad situation would be my motto. First important element, I never asked myself what my aspiration was, what mattered to me. Everything that happened to me was reframed as a source of joy. I saw it as good fortune, and my grounded attitude told me to always see the bright side of things.

This bright side of things helped me overcome many things, but today I see it was a way to flee pain. I never fought for something that mattered to me. I always preferred to see it as an opportunity to change, and what happened to me was happy.

Today, I know that doing what matters to me is important, and may go through phases of discipline without fun, and living with that allows me to stay centered.

### Exercises for Deprogramming Compulsions for Type 7

Now that we have discovered the compulsions of type 7 as these invisible currents that draw us toward the illusion of freedom but chain us to a perpetual cycle of sabotage, it's time to take action with deprogramming exercises – iterative and personalized tools to release these patterns, avoiding superficial symptom attenuation for deep healing that frees your potential.

Inspired by Hudson, who sees compulsions as "fixations" of the ego to release through affirmations, these exercises are not rigid routines that would limit your enthusiasm; they are flexible and creative invitations to observe, analyze, and confront your compulsions, starting with the surface to build confidence, moving through the medium stage to deprogram, and reaching the deep stage to transcend toward a life where you decide for yourself.

Exercise 1 – Observe Your Two Paths: Flight or Integration

Goal: Recognize when you distance yourself from yourself (disintegration toward the stress of the 1) and when you ground yourself (integration toward the depth of the 5). Duration: 10–15 minutes per day

Steps:

1. Recall your day. Note two moments:

   - One where you felt rigid, demanding, impatient (disintegration);

   - One where you felt calm, curious, grounded (integration).

2. For each moment, write:

   - What I felt in my body;

   - What I wanted to avoid;

   - What changed in my breathing or inner tone.

3. Read your notes without judging yourself. Simply notice the differences in energy.

What You Will Notice:

You'll see that your disintegration doesn't come from "fault" or stress, but from a fear of losing freedom.

And that your integration happens when you settle enough to taste your own presence.

Integration isn't slowing down. It's rediscovering the freedom to choose your direction.

Exercise 2 – Consciously Choose Your Energy for the Day

Goal: Move from the reflex of dispersion to a conscious choice of inner orientation.

Duration: 10 minutes in the morning

Steps:

1. Each morning, before opening your phone, take your notebook.

2. Note:

   - My current energy (tired, excited, distracted...).

   - What I choose to amplify today (e.g.: calm, depth, simple joy).

3. Close your eyes and visualize yourself acting from this chosen quality.

4. During the day, observe: return to it every time you feel your mind racing.

What You Will Notice:

You'll understand that you can channel your enthusiasm instead of being overwhelmed by it.

This practice transforms your hyperactivity into inner direction – the mark of a mature 7.

Joy is not found in adding, but in choosing what matters.

Exercise 3 – Return to the Calm of the 5

Goal: Explore the natural integration path of the 7 toward the 5 – learn to savor depth without fearing it.

Duration: 20 minutes

Steps:

1. Settle in a quiet space. Breathe slowly.

2. Choose a subject that excites you (idea, project, reading).

3. For 5 minutes, observe your desire to do more, to accelerate, to move on to the next.

4. Then, slow down voluntarily. Keep the same subject, but explore it in silence:

   - What happens if I stay?

   - What do I discover when I no longer seek to understand quickly?

5. Note what you feel in your body and mind.

What You Will Notice:

You'll taste the beauty of concentration – not as a constraint, but as a door to your own depth.

You'll see that the peace of the 5 is not cold: it is rich, stable, and nourishes you differently from excitement.

Integration is the inner adventure that the 7 often forgets to explore.

Exercise 4 – Connect Your Paths in a Growth Spiral

Goal: Visualize your evolution path and understand how your cycles repeat to better orient them.

Duration: 30 minutes

Steps:

1. On a sheet, draw a spiral starting from the center.

   - The center: your calm, your axis.

   - The circles outward: the moments where you scatter or rigidify.

2. For each circle, note:

   - What you feel in those moments (tension, euphoria, fatigue...).

   - What you unconsciously seek (flight, freedom, recognition...).

3. Look at your spiral and draw an arrow toward the center:

   - What brings me back there?

   - What practices, what people help me stay connected to myself?

4. End with an intention sentence:

"I choose the growth that connects me, not the one that scatters me."

What You Will Notice:

You'll see that your cycles have logic, not inevitability.

The spiral reminds you that you evolve through successive movements – each return to calm is a rise in consciousness.

Growing isn't rising above yourself, it's returning to your center at every turn.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this chapter on the compulsions of type 7 has reminded us that these invisible currents are not inevitable enemies, but signals from the ego that we can deprogram for a liberated life, where you transform your reactivity into conscious and fulfilled choices.

We have seen that compulsions, defined as automatic responses forged to protect against the fear of limitation, play a dual role of survival and sabotage, but by confronting them through a 5-step guide, you open the door to deep healing that goes beyond symptom attenuation for real emancipation.

For me, this deprogramming was transformative: by releasing my compulsive avoidance, rooted in a childhood trauma of restrictions, I began to choose myself, to take care of myself instead of pleasing others, a shift that led me to grounded joy rather than a constant quest.

This process invites collective reliance: your compulsions are not isolated, but interconnected with the world, where deprogramming the ego allows you to contribute authentically, avoiding the pitfalls of superficial growth. The hope is palpable: by deprogramming these compulsions, you make the unconscious conscious, as Jung says, directing your life instead of enduring it, and transcending for a complete personality where you reintegrate qualities from other types.>)
