Bien sûr 🙂 Voici une traduction fluide, naturelle et éditorialement solide en anglais, pensée pour un **lecteur anglophone** (pas une traduction mot à mot) :

**What if your joy isn’t where you’ve been looking for it?**  
Enneagram Type 7 is constantly chasing ideas, projects, and sensations to avoid a pain it would rather not face. The result? A life that is full… but rarely inhabited. Immense energy… often scattered. A bright optimism… yet fragile.

In this book, Pascal Ogil shares the honest—and sometimes unexpected—journey of a modern epicurean who transformed a lifelong escape into a **grounded, calm, and lasting joy**. Through concrete examples, key moments of awareness, and accessible practices, he shows how to:

- recognize avoidance without guilt,
    
- soothe the fear of insignificance,
    
- move from mental agitation to embodied presence,
    
- integrate the focus and depth of Type 5,
    
- and build a life that is chosen rather than endured.
    

A clear, living, and transformative guide for anyone who wants to **slow down, feel more deeply, and finally taste their own joy**—not the one expected by others, nor the one they perform.

**A book for Type 7s (and those who love them), but also for anyone ready to step out of autopilot and live with greater depth.**
