## **Foreword**

It took me a long time before I was able to write a book. I chose to share my discoveries with you after several years of exploring my type through the Enneagram.

Discovering myself—seeing how profoundly I could fail to see myself, learning to be honest with myself, learning to offer myself compassion throughout this process—was a journey in itself.

Because yes, self-discovery is not simple. We can clearly feel the gap between the life we want to live and the life we actually live. Each of us carries automatisms shaped by our past experiences—patterns that once helped us survive or adapt as best we could.

When we begin to uncover these mechanisms, our life is illuminated by a new light. It can be painful, but above all, it brings understanding. And everyone is free to stop wherever they wish on their personal development path. It is a personal journey, and only you can decide how far you want to go.

As for me, I chose to face these automatisms, these compulsions, and to ask myself what life would look like if I stepped out of autopilot and dared to truly live. As someone who identifies with Type 7, I naturally lean toward joy and toward embracing life fully—exploring new ideas, skills, places, and experiences. It has always felt like a great strength. And yet one day, I realized that this perpetual exploration was also keeping me from making decisions that were truly for me—decisions that could root me in something aligned with my deeper aspirations. This is the story I share with you in this book.

I have done a lot of inner work, and I have been supported by psychologists, coaches, and friends. A book will not solve everything, of course, but it may bring new clarity to your own life.

I am myself a Certified Professional Coach. This training has given me many tools—around emotions, Nonviolent Communication to explore what happens within me, Transactional Analysis to understand how I act, and many others. They have all supported my journey.

Walking this path is not easy, because it invites us to question and rethink many aspects of our lives. And I can only encourage you to seek support—someone to walk alongside you, to talk with, to lean on. Feel free to contact me if you wish to exchange or benefit from personalized coaching. I would be delighted to share moments of dialogue and exploration with you.

I wish you an enriching reading experience and many meaningful insights.
