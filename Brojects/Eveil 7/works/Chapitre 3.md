## **Why Change?**

I remember a time when I was juggling three projects at once. I was enthusiastic, energized, convinced that I could handle everything simultaneously. But after a few weeks, things began to unravel: I was doing a thousand things at once, yet nothing was truly moving forward, and I… I was escaping my frustration by launching new ideas—each more exciting than the last.  
It wasn’t courage, nor even creativity. It was an automatic response: a flight from the pain of failure, disguised as enthusiasm.
That day, I realized that what I thought was my freedom was actually a gilded cage. My enthusiasm, my creativity—those qualities that led me into constant dispersion and that I believed were my strengths—were actually sabotaging what mattered most to me: depth, trust, stability. And it was by allowing myself to sit with my discomfort, instead of running toward the next distraction, that I discovered a quieter, truer kind of joy.

## **The Trap of Automatic Patterns**

Our automatisms are first and foremost protections.  
They helped us survive, adapt, and avoid pain.  
But over time, as we react mechanically, we eventually exhaust ourselves.

- The perfectionist corrects until exhaustion.
    
- The helper gives endlessly… and wears out from not receiving.
    
- The achiever stacks up successes… yet no longer knows who they are behind the mask.
    
- The enthusiast multiplies experiences… and can no longer bear silence.
    

As long as we remain identified with these mechanisms, we believe we “are like this”—and that is where personality tests can become dangerous. They reinforce these identities. We justify our reactions because something “confirms” that this is who we are.  
But the truth is: we are not our automatisms. They are only a protective layer, an old piece of software.

---

## **Why Make the Effort to Change?**

The question is legitimate: why embark on a path that is sometimes uncomfortable? Why face what we’ve spent years avoiding?  
It is always more comfortable to stay in what we know—even if it is far from ideal.

Remaining in automatism has a cost:

- The cost of relationships damaged by disproportionate reactions.
    
- The cost of projects sabotaged by our avoidance or rigidity.
    
- The cost of a fragile joy, dependent on circumstances.
    

By contrast, choosing to grow brings concrete benefits:

- Less self-sabotage in our lives.
    
- More inner freedom when confronted with triggers.
    
- More authentic relationships, less conditioned by our fears.
    
- And above all: a more grounded joy, less dependent on the external world.
    

I would never have been able to complete this book if I had stayed stuck in my Type 7 compulsions. Staying focused on a single project means fearing that I’m missing out on other opportunities. It’s also a form of self-sabotage that keeps me from achieving what truly matters most to me, when I look deeply.

Changing doesn’t mean becoming someone else. It means rediscovering who we were before the ego’s armor took over.

---

## **The Paradox of the Ego**

The ego is not “bad.” It is a survival strategy.  
It was built to protect us from a fundamental fear: abandonment, failure, rejection, weakness… whatever it may be. But what once saved us often becomes our prison today.

The progression described by the Enneagram is not a battle against the ego. It is a path toward observing it, understanding it, and gradually no longer confusing it with our deeper self. Our deeper self longs to live a fulfilled life; yet the ego, in its desire to protect us, often prevents that fulfillment because it is so focused on keeping us safe.

---

## **A Hope for Transcendence**

Here lies the hope: our automatisms are not fate.  
They are signals, entry points.  
Recognizing them is the first step toward transforming them into choices.  
And behind those choices lies the possibility of a life less endured and more consciously lived.

Where I once believed I needed to run ever faster, I discovered the power of slowing down.  
Where some believe they must control everything, they discover the peace of letting go.  
Where others think they must constantly charm, they discover the joy of being loved simply for who they are.

It’s not an easy path, but it is a liberating one.

---

## **Practical Exercise**

Take a moment and write down:

1. Three recurring frustrations from your recent life (e.g., a conflict, procrastination, an escape).
    
2. For each one, ask yourself: _Why did I avoid or react this way?_
    
3. Observe without judgment. The goal isn’t to fix anything—only to see.
    

This simple exercise is a first step: turning what seemed “normal” into an object of awareness.

Changing is not a moral obligation nor a performance goal.  
It is an invitation to live with less constraint and more presence.  
It is the shift from automatism to consciousness.

In the next section, we’ll explore how this process begins: learning to take a step back, adopting a meta-view of our behaviors, and recognizing our patterns without identifying with them.

---

# **Gaining Perspective: The Meta-View**

Change always begins with one fundamental movement: _seeing._  
As long as we are glued to our reactions, they seem normal, inevitable—“it’s just how I am.”  
Progress becomes possible when we manage to take a step back, to observe our behaviors as if watching a movie.

---

## **Discovering That Other Logics Exist**

The first encounter with the Enneagram—or any tool for self-knowledge—is often a revelation. We come to understand that our reactions are not universal. What feels “obvious” to me is not obvious for others.

A Type 7 escapes discomfort through distraction.  
A Type 1 faces discomfort through discipline.  
A Type 9 dissolves into harmony to avoid conflict.

Seeing these differences creates a shift:  
_“Ah… so what I do is not a destiny—it’s a strategy.”_

---

## **From Inside to Outside: The Side Step**

The meta-view is this side step.  
It’s the ability to say:

- “Oh, I’m trying to please at all costs right now.”
    
- “Oh, I’m starting yet another project without finishing the previous one.”
    
- “Oh, I’m correcting a detail that doesn’t really matter.”
    

This isn’t deep transformation yet, but it’s the beginning of distance.  
Instead of being inside the reaction, you can begin to _see_ it.  
And this little space—between action and observation—is the crack through which awareness enters.

---

## **Confronting the Shadow Zones**

Of course, this step back isn’t always comfortable.  
Observing our patterns also means seeing what we preferred to ignore: fear, dependency, rigidity, avoidance.  
It means meeting our shadow.

A personal example: one day in a work meeting, I realized I was nodding in agreement… even though I disagreed.  
I wanted to avoid conflict, preserve harmony—but I was betraying myself.  
In that moment, I felt shame and discomfort.  
But that awareness planted a seed: I began noticing that avoidance mechanism appearing in other situations.

This moment of clarity isn’t pleasant, but it’s precious.  
Because as long as we haven’t named our patterns, they govern us silently.

---

## **A Shift in Perspective**

Taking the meta-view is like shifting from actor to spectator of your own life.  
The action continues, but the inner observer awakens.

Instead of saying, “I’m like this,” we can say, “I see that I’m doing this.”  
A small nuance in appearance—yet in reality, enormous.  
It is the shift from _I am_ to _I observe._


### **Practical Exercise**

For one week, take a notebook and each evening write down:

1. **One automatic reaction you had during the day**  
    (anger, avoidance, rigidity, people-pleasing, etc.)
    
2. **Rephrase it into a sentence beginning with:** _“I notice that…”_
    
    - Example: _“I notice that I said yes even though I meant no.”_
        
    - Example: _“I notice that I jumped into a new project to avoid feeling bored.”_
        

The goal is not to fix or judge anything, but simply to **see**.

This meta-view is a subtle but decisive step.  
It does not transform the pattern yet, but it **breaks the illusion that you are ‘condemned’ to react this way.**  
It prepares the ground for the next stage: bringing to light what, until now, remained invisible.

This is what we will explore in the next section:  
**how to move from general observation to a precise awareness of your automatic patterns, so you can begin to deprogram them.**

---

# **Shedding Light on the Invisible**

Observing your reactions is progress.  
But often, what we see on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg.  
Behind our automatisms lie deeper motivations—fears and desires working behind the scenes.  
This is the “invisible” we are now going to illuminate.

---

## **Automatism: A Survival Strategy**

Every automatic pattern has a logic:  
It protected us once.

- The perfectionist (Type 1) corrected to avoid criticism.
    
- The helper (Type 2) made themselves indispensable to feel loved.
    
- The achiever (Type 3) performed to avoid rejection.
    

These strategies worked—they were vital in childhood.  
But in adulthood, they become rigid, mechanical, outdated.  
They respond to a past that no longer exists.

---

## **The Ego as a Filter**

The ego works like an invisible pair of glasses.  
It colors reality according to its core fear:

- Type 1 sees imperfection everywhere.
    
- Type 6 sees potential threats everywhere.
    
- Type 7 sees opportunities to escape boredom everywhere.
    

This filter doesn’t feel like a filter—it feels like _the truth._  
That is what makes it so hard to notice.

Lighting up the invisible means acknowledging that what seems objectively true is often just a projection of the ego.

---

## **Pain and Suffering: Two Different Realities**

A key teaching is distinguishing between pain and suffering.

- **Pain** is inevitable: loss, separation, failure.
    
- **Suffering** arises from our automatic resistance to pain.
    

Example: a project fails.  
Pain is the disappointment.  
Suffering is the story we tell ourselves:  
“I’m useless, this always happens, I must start something new quickly to forget.”

The automatic pattern turns a limited event into a spiral of suffering.

Becoming aware of this mechanism already weakens its power.

---

## **A Moment of Truth**

I remember a day, after a heated meeting, when a wave of anger rose in me.  
My reflex would have been to send a sharp email, to regain control.  
But by pausing for a moment, I saw something else: my fear of being humiliated.  
Behind my anger was a vulnerability I didn’t want to feel.

That clarity changed my response: instead of attacking, I calmly named my feelings.  
The situation softened.  
It wasn’t easy—but it was the first time I felt the freedom of a real choice.

### **Practical Exercise**

For one week, choose three situations in which you felt discomfort (anger, fear, avoidance, rigidity). For each one:

1. **Write down the visible automatic reaction**  
    (e.g., “I interrupted to regain control.”)
    
2. **Ask yourself:** _“What was I trying not to feel?”_  
    (e.g., fear of losing my place, fear of being insignificant.)
    
3. **Take 10 minutes to breathe and simply welcome this avoided emotion**, without escaping it.
    

The goal is not to solve it right away, but to **see it**.  
What was invisible becomes an object of awareness.

Bringing the invisible to light means accepting to look beneath the surface.  
It’s not comfortable, but it is the necessary passage for our compulsions to stop secretly running our lives.

In the next section, we will explore how to turn these insights into concrete experiments, and how to connect your automatic reactions back to their origin: **the deeper needs they were trying to protect.**

---

# **Experimenting and Understanding the “Why”**

Observing automatisms is progress.  
But if we stop there, we risk becoming powerless spectators of our own reactions.  
The next step is daring to experiment and exploring the deeper meaning of our compulsions.

---

## **Breaking the Auto-Pilot Through Experience**

Awareness doesn’t grow only through reflection.  
It grows through experience.

Practically, this means choosing—just once—to do something different.

- The perfectionist leaves a small imperfection on purpose.
    
- The helper dares to say no and observes the reaction.
    
- The achiever openly shares a failure instead of hiding it.
    
- The enthusiast stays with boredom instead of fleeing into a new distraction.
    

These modest but concrete experiments create a crack in the compulsion.  
They open a space where a new behavior becomes possible.

---

## **Returning to the “Why”**

Every compulsion has a story.  
It once protected something fragile in us:

- The need to be loved.
    
- The need to be recognized.
    
- The need to feel safe.
    

In childhood, these automatisms were intelligent—they helped us adapt.  
But in adulthood, they become rigid, inappropriate, even harmful.

Understanding this “why”—this root need—is not about blaming parents or the past, but about recognizing that our pattern makes sense.  
And because the need is legitimate, we can find more conscious ways to meet it.

---

## **Healing Rather Than Dampening**

Many personal development approaches focus on mitigation:  
managing stress, breathing to calm anger, planning to avoid procrastination.  
Useful… but not transformative.

Real healing occurs when we recognize the root fear and face it.  
When we stop running and discover that the fear no longer holds the power it once had over the child we were.

Mitigation repairs the surface temporarily; healing frees us deeply.

---

## **Anecdote: Staying With Discomfort**

I recall an evening when I wanted to dive into a new project, knowing it was an escape.  
I decided to sit still, without opening my computer.  
At first, it was unbearable—agitation, the urge to fill the void.  
Then, after a while, something softened.  
I felt the sadness behind my automatisms, and I was able to experience it without drowning in it.

That moment was a turning point:  
I understood that behind the agitation was simply an emotion I didn’t want to meet.

---

## **Practical Exercise**

1. Choose one recurring automatic pattern (perfectionism, avoidance, seduction, control, etc.).
    
2. For one week, decide to suspend it just once per day:
    
    - Leaving a task unfinished.
        
    - Saying “no” to a request.
        
    - Not launching a new idea.
        
3. Observe what it triggers in you: fear, anger, sadness, emptiness.
    
4. Write in your journal:  
    **“This automatism serves to… but today I can also…”**
    

This exercise connects observation to meaning—and meaning to new freedom.

Experimenting and understanding the why unites two movements:  
action and depth.  
One without the other is incomplete.  
Experience without meaning remains superficial.  
Meaning without experience remains theoretical.  
Together, they open the door to real transformation.

In the next section, we’ll see how these insights and experiments weave into a daily life that becomes less automatic, where inner freedom gradually becomes a habit.

---

# **A Less Automatic Life**

By this stage, you’ve understood the logic of automatisms, learned to observe them, begun revealing the invisible, and experimented with new ways of acting.  
One essential question remains:  
How do you make this awareness part of everyday life?  
How do you turn occasional insights into a durable way of living?

---

## **From Insight to Integration**

A moment of clarity can change a reaction, but it’s not enough to change a life.  
Automatisms will return—inevitably.  
They are old, deep, wired into our reflexes.

The goal isn’t to “eliminate them once and for all,” but to build a habit of awareness.

Like physical training, progress comes through repetition.  
By observing, naming, experimenting again and again, the space of freedom expands.  
Where yesterday we reacted without choice, today we begin to feel the wave coming… and decide how to surf it.

---

## **Three Concrete Benefits**

When awareness becomes a practice, three major changes unfold:

1. **Less self-sabotage:** conflicts, scatter, and rigidity decrease.
    
2. **More authentic relationships:** by recognizing our fears and strategies, we become clearer, more honest, more available to others.
    
3. **A more stable joy:** no longer fleeting excitement or unreachable perfection, but a quieter presence less dependent on circumstances.
    

These benefits do not appear overnight.  
They settle gradually—like a silent transformation.

---

## **Missteps Are Part of the Journey**

It’s important to remember that this process is not linear.  
There will be relapses, setbacks, moments when old patterns resurface.  
This is normal.

The key is not to judge these moments, but to see them as invitations to begin again.  
Every moment of awareness—even after a “regression”—expands your freedom a little more.

---

## **Projection Exercise**

Take a few minutes and imagine:

- If one year from now your automatisms had 20% less control over your life, what would be different?
    
- Which relationships would feel easier?
    
- Which projects would be more solid?
    
- What inner weight would be lighter?
    

Write down your answers.  
This simple exercise gives a clear direction to your progress:  
not impossible perfection, but tangible, realistic, motivating change.

---

## **A Living Practice**

Living less under the rule of automatisms is not a static state.  
It is a living, breathing practice.  
Each day, each interaction is an opportunity to see, to choose, to practice.

With time, awareness becomes like a muscle:  
the more it is used, the stronger it grows.

---

## **Chapter Conclusion**

Moving from automatism to awareness is not a promise of perfection.  
It is an invitation to live more freely, more consciously, more authentically.  
It marks the beginning of an inner transformation that also reshapes how we relate to the world.

Just tell me!](<### Why Change?

I remember a period when I was juggling three projects at the same time. I was enthusiastic, carried by the energy, convinced that I could handle everything at once. But after a few weeks, things started to unravel: I was doing a thousand things at once, and at the same time, I wasn't really making any progress, and me... I was fleeing my frustration by launching even more exciting new ideas. It wasn't courage, nor even creativity. It was an automatism: an escape from the pain of failure, camouflaged under the appearance of enthusiasm.

That day, I realized that what I believed to be my freedom was just a gilded prison. My enthusiasm, my creativity, which led me to dispersion and which seemed to be my strength, was actually sabotaging what mattered most to me: depth, confidence, stability. And it was by accepting to sit with my discomfort, instead of running toward the next distraction, that I discovered a calmer, truer joy.

The Trap of Automatisms

Our automatisms are first and foremost protections.

They have allowed us to survive, to adapt, to avoid pain.

But by reacting mechanically over time, we end up exhausting ourselves.

- The perfectionist corrects until exhaustion.

- The helper gives endlessly... and exhausts themselves from not receiving.

- The achiever chains successes... but no longer knows who they are behind their masks.

- The enthusiast multiplies experiences... and can no longer bear silence.

As long as we remain identified with these mechanisms, we believe "that's just how I am," and that's the risk of personality tests. Justifying our reactions because something confirms that we are like that. But the truth is, we are not our automatisms. They are just a protective layer, an old software.

Why Make the Effort to Change?

The question is legitimate: why embark on a path that is sometimes uncomfortable? Why face what we've spent years avoiding? It's much more comfortable to live what we know, even if it's not always ideal.

Because staying in automatism has a price:

- The price of damaged relationships due to our disproportionate reactions.

- The price of sabotaged projects due to our escapes or rigidities.

- The price of fragile joy, dependent on circumstances.

Conversely, choosing to progress means reaping concrete benefits:

- Less sabotage in our lives.

- More inner freedom in the face of triggers.

- Truer relationships, because less conditioned by our fears.

- And above all: a more grounded joy, less dependent on the outside.

I would never have been able to finish writing this book if I had stayed with my compulsions of a 7. Staying focused on a project is the fear of missing out on lots of opportunities. It's also a sabotage to not achieve what truly matters to me, if I look deeply.

Changing isn't about transforming into someone else. It's about rediscovering what we were before the armor of the ego took over everything.

The Paradox of the Ego

The ego isn't "bad." It's a survival strategy. It was built to protect us from a fundamental fear: abandonment, failure, rejection, weakness... Whatever it may be. But what saved us yesterday often becomes our prison today.

The progression that the Enneagram talks about isn't a fight against the ego, but a path to observe it, understand it, and gradually stop confusing it with our deep being. Our deep being has an aspiration to live a fulfilled life; somewhere, our ego, through its desire for protection, also protects us, and prevents us from moving toward fulfillment, so much is it focused on protecting us.

A Hope of Transcendence

This is where hope lies: our automatisms are not inevitable. They are signals, entry points. Recognizing them is the first step to transforming them into choices. And behind that choice, there is the possibility of a less endured life, more conscious.

Where I thought I had to run ever faster, I discovered the power of slowing down. Where some believe they must control, they discover the peace of letting go. Where others think they must seduce, they discover the joy of being loved simply for who they are.

It's not an easy path, but it's a liberating one.

Practical Exercise

Take a moment and note:

1. Three recurring frustrations from your recent life (e.g.: a conflict, procrastination, an escape).

2. For each, ask yourself: Why did I flee or react this way?

3. Observe without judgment. The goal isn't to correct, but to see.

This simple exercise is a first step: transforming what seemed "normal" into an object of consciousness.

Changing isn't a moral injunction, nor a performance goal. It's an invitation to live less under constraint, more in presence. It's the passage from automatism to consciousness.

In the next section, we will see how this process begins: learning to gain perspective, adopting a meta view on our behaviors, and recognizing our patterns without identifying with them.

### Gaining Perspective: The Meta View

Changing always starts with a first movement: seeing. As long as we are stuck to our reactions, they seem normal, inevitable, "that's just me." Progression becomes possible when we manage to take a step back, to look at our behaviors as if we were watching a movie.

Discovering That Other Logics Exist

The first time one encounters the Enneagram, or another self-knowledge tool, it's often a revelation. We understand that our reactions are not universal. What seems "obvious" to me isn't to my neighbor.

A type 7 flees pain by distracting themselves. A type 1 faces discomfort by redoubling rigor. A type 9 dissolves into harmony to avoid conflict.

By seeing these differences, a click happens: "Ah, so what I do isn't inevitable, it's a strategy."

From Inside to Outside: The Step Aside

The meta view is this step aside. It's the ability to say to oneself:

- "Hey, I'm trying to please at all costs."

- "Hey, I'm starting a new project without finishing the previous one."

- "Hey, I'm correcting another detail that isn't that important."

It's not yet a deep change, but it's the beginning of distance. Instead of being in the reaction, we can start to see it. And this small space, between action and observation, is a crack through which consciousness can enter.

Confronting Shadow Zones

Of course, this step back isn't always comfortable. Because observing one's patterns also means seeing what we preferred to ignore: fear, dependence, rigidity, escape. It's meeting one's shadow zones.

A personal example: one day, in the middle of a work discussion, I realized I was nodding to approve... even though I didn't agree. I wanted to avoid conflict, preserve harmony, but I was denying myself. At the moment, I felt shame and discomfort. But this awareness planted a seed: I started to see my avoidance automatism appear in other situations.

This moment of lucidity isn't pleasant, but it's precious. Because as long as we haven't named these patterns, they govern us in silence.

A Shift in Perspective

Taking the meta view is like going from the role of actor to spectator in one's own life. The action continues, but the inner eye awakens. This shift doesn't eliminate the automatism, but it creates a space of freedom.

Instead of saying "I'm like that," we can say: "I see that I'm doing that." This nuance, minimal in appearance, is actually gigantic. It's the passage from "I am" to "I observe."

### Practical Exercise

During a week, take a notebook and note each evening:

1. An automatic reaction from your day (anger, escape, rigidity, seduction, etc.).

2. Rephrase it in a sentence starting with: "I see that..."

   - Example: "I see that I said yes when I thought no."

   - Example: "I see that I started a new project to avoid boredom."

The goal isn't to correct or judge, but simply to look.

The meta view is a discreet but decisive step. It doesn't yet transform the automatism, but it breaks the illusion of being "condemned to react this way." It prepares the ground for the next: bringing to light what, until now, remained invisible.

That's what we'll explore in the next section: how to go from general observation to a fine awareness of our automatisms, in order to start deprogramming them.

### Bringing the Invisible to Light

Observing one's reactions is already progress. But often, what we see on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg. Behind our automatisms lie deeper motivations, fears, and desires that operate backstage. It's this "invisible" that we're going to bring to light.

The Automatism: A Survival Strategy

Every automatism has a logic: it protected us one day. The perfectionist (type 1) corrected to avoid criticism. The helper (type 2) made themselves indispensable to be loved. The achiever (3) performed to not be rejected.

These strategies worked—in childhood, they were vital. But in adulthood, they become rigid, mechanical, out of place. They respond to a past that no longer exists.

The Ego as Superimposition

The ego acts like an invisible pair of glasses. It colors reality according to its root fear:

- The 1 sees imperfection everywhere.

- The 6 sees potential threats.

- The 7 sees opportunities to escape boredom.

This filter isn't conscious: it imposes itself as obvious. That's why it's so hard to notice. We don't say: "I'm afraid, so I react this way," but rather: "that's how things are."

Bringing the invisible to light is recognizing that what seems like an objective truth is often just a projection of our ego.

Suffering and Pain: Two Distinct Realities

A key teaching is to distinguish pain and suffering.

- Pain is inevitable: a loss, a separation, a failure.

- Suffering, on the other hand, arises from our automatic resistance to pain.

Example: a project fails. The pain is the disappointment. But the suffering is the story I tell myself: "I'm worthless, it's always going to happen again, I need to quickly start something else to forget." The automatism turns a limited event into a spiral of suffering.

Becoming aware of this mechanism already reduces its grip.

A Moment of Truth

I remember a day when, after a stormy meeting, I felt a wave of anger rising. My reflex would have been to send a curt email, to regain control. But by stopping for a few moments, I saw something else: my fear of being humiliated. Behind my anger, there was a vulnerability I didn't want to feel.

This moment of lucidity changed my reaction: instead of attacking, I chose to calmly name my feeling. The situation calmed down. It wasn't easy, but it was the first time I felt the freedom of a real choice.

### Practical Exercise

During a week, take three situations where you felt discomfort (anger, fear, escape, rigidity). For each:

1. Note the visible automatism (e.g.: "I interrupted to regain control").

2. Ask yourself: "What didn't I want to feel?" (e.g.: fear of losing my place, fear of being insignificant).

3. Take 10 minutes to breathe and simply welcome this avoided emotion, without fleeing it.

The goal isn't to resolve it immediately, but to see it. What was invisible becomes an object of consciousness.

Bringing the invisible to light is accepting to look beneath the surface. It's not comfortable, but it's the necessary passage for our compulsions to stop directing our life in secret.

In the next section, we'll explore how to transform these awarenesses into concrete experiments, and how to connect our automatisms to their origin: the deep needs they were trying to protect.

### Experiment and Understand the "Why"

Observing one's automatisms is already an advance. But if we stop there, we risk becoming mere powerless spectators of our own reactions. The next step is to dare to experiment with something else and to explore the deep meaning of our compulsions.

Getting Out of Autopilot Through Experience

Consciousness doesn't grow only in reflection. It strengthens through experience.

Concretely, that means: choosing, once, to do differently.

- The perfectionist who decides to voluntarily leave a small imperfection in their work.

- The generous one who dares to say no to a request and observes the reaction.

- The achiever who accepts to talk about a failure instead of hiding it.

- The enthusiast who stays in a moment of boredom instead of escaping to a new distraction.

These experiments, modest but concrete, create a breach in the compulsion. They open a space where a new behavior becomes possible.

Returning to the "Why"

Every compulsion has a story. It served one day to protect something fragile in us.

- The need to be loved.

- The need to be recognized.

- The need for security.

In childhood, these automatisms were intelligent: they allowed us to adapt to our environment. But in adulthood, they become rigid, maladapted, sometimes destructive.

Understanding this why, this root need, isn't about blaming our parents or our past, but recognizing that our compulsion isn't absurd: it has meaning. And since this need is legitimate, we can find more conscious ways to respond to it.

Healing Rather Than Attenuating

Many personal development approaches stop at attenuation: learning to better manage stress, breathing to calm anger, planning to avoid procrastination. It's useful... but it's not a transformation.

True healing is when we recognize the root fear and face it. It's when we stop fleeing, and discover that this fear no longer has the power it had over the child we were.

Where attenuation temporarily repairs the surface, healing liberates in depth.

Anecdote: Staying with Discomfort

I remember an evening when I was tempted to throw myself into a new project, even though I knew it was an escape. I decided to stay seated, without opening my computer. At first, it was unbearable: agitation, a desire to fill the void. Then, after a while, something calmed down. I felt the sadness hiding behind my automatism, and I was able to live it without getting lost in it.

This moment was a turning point: I understood that behind the agitation, there was simply an emotion I didn't want to meet.

Practical Exercise

1. Choose a recurring automatism (perfectionism, escape, seduction, control, etc.).

2. During a week, decide to suspend it once a day.

   - Example: leave a task unfinished.

   - Example: say "no" to a request.

   - Example: don't start a new project.

3. Observe what it triggers in you: fear, anger, sadness, emptiness.

4. Note in your notebook: "This automatism serves to... but today I can also..."

This exercise allows linking observation to meaning, and meaning to a new freedom.

Experimenting and understanding the why is uniting two movements: action and depth. One without the other is incomplete. Experience without meaning remains superficial. Meaning without experience remains theoretical. Together, they open the way to real transformation.

In the next section, we'll see how these awarenesses and experiments integrate into a daily life that is less automated, where inner freedom gradually becomes a habit.

### A Less Automated Life

At this stage, you have understood the logic of automatisms, learned to observe them, started to reveal the invisible, and experimented with other paths. One essential question remains: how to make this consciousness a daily reality? How to transform a series of punctual experiences into a durable way of living?

From the Click to Anchoring

A moment of lucidity can change a reaction, but it's not enough to transform a life. Automatisms will return, that's certain: they are old, deep, integrated into our reflexes. The path doesn't consist of "eliminating them once and for all," but of building a habit of consciousness.

Like physical training, progression comes from repetition. Through observing, naming, experimenting, the space of freedom expands. Where yesterday we reacted without choice, today we start to see the wave coming... and decide how to surf it.

Three Concrete Benefits

When consciousness becomes a practice, three major changes appear:

1. Less sabotage: conflicts, dispersions, or rigidities decrease. We stop shooting ourselves in the foot.

2. Truer relationships: by recognizing our fears and strategies, we become more honest, clearer, more available to others.

3. A more stable joy: no longer ephemeral excitement or inaccessible perfection, but a quieter presence, less dependent on circumstances.

These benefits aren't spectacular overnight. They settle in gradually, like a silent transformation.

Setbacks Are Part of the Path

It's important to remember that this process isn't linear. There will be relapses, moments of discouragement, periods when we fall back into old patterns. That's normal.

The key is not to judge these setbacks, but to see them as an invitation to start again. Each awareness, even after a "relapse," expands the space of freedom a little more.

Projection Exercise

Take a few minutes and imagine:

- If in a year, your automatisms had lost 20% of their grip, what would have changed in your life?

- Which relationships would be smoother?

- Which projects would be more solid?

- What inner weight would have lightened?

Note your answers. This simple exercise allows giving a clear direction to your progression: not an impossible perfection, but a tangible, realistic, and motivating improvement.

A Living Practice

Living less under the grip of automatisms isn't a fixed state, it's a living practice. Every day, every interaction is an opportunity to see, to choose, to exercise.

With time, consciousness becomes like a muscle: the more it's used, the stronger it gets.

Chapter Conclusion

Passing from automatism to consciousness isn't a promise of perfection, but an invitation to live more free, more present, more true. It's the beginning of an inner transformation that also touches our way of being in connection with the world.>)
