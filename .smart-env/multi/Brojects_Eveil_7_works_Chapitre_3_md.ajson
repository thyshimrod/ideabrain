time when I was juggling three projects at once. I was enthusiastic, energized, convinced that I could handle everything simultaneously. But after a few weeks, things began to unravel: I was doing a thousand things at once, yet nothing was truly moving forward, and I… I was escaping my frustration by launching new ideas—each more exciting than the last.  \nIt wasn’t courage, nor even creativity. It was an automatic response: a flight from the pain of failure, disguised as enthusiasm.\nThat day, I realized that what I thought was my freedom was actually a gilded cage. My enthusiasm, my creativity—those qualities that led me into constant dispersion and that I believed were my strengths—were actually sabotaging what mattered most to me: depth, trust, stability. And it was by allowing myself to sit with my discomfort, instead of running toward the next distraction, that I discovered a quieter, truer kind of joy.\n\n\n---\n\n## **The Trap of Automatic Patterns**\n\nOur automatisms are first and foremost protections.  \nThey helped us survive, adapt, and avoid pain.  \nBut over time, as we react mechanically, we eventually exhaust ourselves.\n\n- The perfectionist corrects until exhaustion.\n    \n- The helper gives endlessly… and wears out from not receiving.\n    \n- The achiever stacks up successes… yet no longer knows who they are behind the mask.\n    \n- The enthusiast multiplies experiences… and can no longer bear silence.\n    \n\nAs long as we remain identified with these mechanisms, we believe we “are like this”—and that is where personality tests can become dangerous. They reinforce these identities. We justify our reactions because something “confirms” that this is who we are.  \nBut the truth is: we are not our automatisms. They are only a protective layer, an old piece of software.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Make the Effort to Change?**\n\nThe question is legitimate: why embark on a path that is sometimes uncomfortable? Why face what we’ve spent years avoiding?  \nIt is always more comfortable to stay in what we know—even if it is far from ideal.\n\nRemaining in automatism has a cost:\n\n- The cost of relationships damaged by disproportionate reactions.\n    \n- The cost of projects sabotaged by our avoidance or rigidity.\n    \n- The cost of a fragile joy, dependent on circumstances.\n    \n\nBy contrast, choosing to grow brings concrete benefits:\n\n- Less self-sabotage in our lives.\n    \n- More inner freedom when confronted with triggers.\n    \n- More authentic relationships, less conditioned by our fears.\n    \n- And above all: a more grounded joy, less dependent on the external world.\n    \n\nI would never have been able to complete this book if I had stayed stuck in my Type 7 compulsions. Staying focused on a single project means fearing that I’m missing out on other opportunities. It’s also a form of self-sabotage that keeps me from achieving what truly matters most to me, when I look deeply.\n\nChanging doesn’t mean becoming someone else. It means rediscovering who we were before the ego’s armor took over.\n\n---\n\n## **The Paradox of the Ego**\n\nThe ego is not “bad.” It is a survival strategy.  \nIt was built to protect us from a fundamental fear: abandonment, failure, rejection, weakness… whatever it may be. But what once saved us often becomes our prison today.\n\nThe progression described by the Enneagram is not a battle against the ego. It is a path toward observing it, understanding it, and gradually no longer confusing it with our deeper self. Our deeper self longs to live a fulfilled life; yet the ego, in its desire to protect us, often prevents that fulfillment because it is so focused on keeping us safe.\n\n---\n\n## **A Hope for Transcendence**\n\nHere lies the hope: our automatisms are not fate.  \nThey are signals, entry points.  \nRecognizing them is the first step toward transforming them into choices.  \nAnd behind those choices lies the possibility of a life less endured and more consciously lived.\n\nWhere I once believed I needed to run ever faster, I discovered the power of slowing down.  \nWhere some believe they must control everything, they discover the peace of letting go.  \nWhere others think they must constantly charm, they discover the joy of being loved simply for who they are.\n\nIt’s not an easy path, but it is a liberating one.\n\n---\n\n## **Practical Exercise**\n\nTake a moment and write down:\n\n1. Three recurring frustrations from your recent life (e.g., a conflict, procrastination, an escape).\n    \n2. For each one, ask yourself: _Why did I avoid or react this way?_\n    \n3. Observe without judgment. The goal isn’t to fix anything—only to see.\n    \n\nThis simple exercise is a first step: turning what seemed “normal” into an object of awareness.\n\nChanging is not a moral obligation nor a performance goal.  \nIt is an invitation to live with less constraint and more presence.  \nIt is the shift from automatism to consciousness.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll explore how this process begins: learning to take a step back, adopting a meta-view of our behaviors, and recognizing our patterns without identifying with them.\n\n---\n\n# **Gaining Perspective: The Meta-View**\n\nChange always begins with one fundamental movement: _seeing._  \nAs long as we are glued to our reactions, they seem normal, inevitable—“it’s just how I am.”  \nProgress becomes possible when we manage to take a step back, to observe our behaviors as if watching a movie.\n\n---\n\n## **Discovering That Other Logics Exist**\n\nThe first encounter with the Enneagram—or any tool for self-knowledge—is often a revelation. We come to understand that our reactions are not universal. What feels “obvious” to me is not obvious for others.\n\nA Type 7 escapes discomfort through distraction.  \nA Type 1 faces discomfort through discipline.  \nA Type 9 dissolves into harmony to avoid conflict.\n\nSeeing these differences creates a shift:  \n_“Ah… so what I do is not a destiny—it’s a strategy.”_\n\n---\n\n## **From Inside to Outside: The Side Step**\n\nThe meta-view is this side step.  \nIt’s the ability to say:\n\n- “Oh, I’m trying to please at all costs right now.”\n    \n- “Oh, I’m starting yet another project without finishing the previous one.”\n    \n- “Oh, I’m correcting a detail that doesn’t really matter.”\n    \n\nThis isn’t deep transformation yet, but it’s the beginning of distance.  \nInstead of being inside the reaction, you can begin to _see_ it.  \nAnd this little space—between action and observation—is the crack through which awareness enters.\n\n---\n\n## **Confronting the Shadow Zones**\n\nOf course, this step back isn’t always comfortable.  \nObserving our patterns also means seeing what we preferred to ignore: fear, dependency, rigidity, avoidance.  \nIt means meeting our shadow.\n\nA personal example: one day in a work meeting, I realized I was nodding in agreement… even though I disagreed.  \nI wanted to avoid conflict, preserve harmony—but I was betraying myself.  \nIn that moment, I felt shame and discomfort.  \nBut that awareness planted a seed: I began noticing that avoidance mechanism appearing in other situations.\n\nThis moment of clarity isn’t pleasant, but it’s precious.  \nBecause as long as we haven’t named our patterns, they govern us silently.\n\n---\n\n## **A Shift in Perspective**\n\nTaking the meta-view is like shifting from actor to spectator of your own life.  \nThe action continues, but the inner observer awakens.\n\nInstead of saying, “I’m like this,” we can say, “I see that I’m doing this.”  \nA small nuance in appearance—yet in reality, enormous.  \nIt is the shift from _I am_ to _I observe._\n\n\n### **Practical Exercise**\n\nFor one week, take a notebook and each evening write down:\n\n1. **One automatic reaction you had during the day**  \n    (anger, avoidance, rigidity, people-pleasing, etc.)\n    \n2. **Rephrase it into a sentence beginning with:** _“I notice that…”_\n    \n    - Example: _“I notice that I said yes even though I meant no.”_\n        \n    - Example: _“I notice that I jumped into a new project to avoid feeling bored.”_\n        \n\nThe goal is not to fix or judge anything, but simply to **see**.\n\nThis meta-view is a subtle but decisive step.  \nIt does not transform the pattern yet, but it **breaks the illusion that you are ‘condemned’ to react this way.**  \nIt prepares the ground for the next stage: bringing to light what, until now, remained invisible.\n\nThis is what we will explore in the next section:  \n**how to move from general observation to a precise awareness of your automatic patterns, so you can begin to deprogram them.**\n\n---\n\n# **Shedding Light on the Invisible**\n\nObserving your reactions is progress.  \nBut often, what we see on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg.  \nBehind our automatisms lie deeper motivations—fears and desires working behind the scenes.  \nThis is the “invisible” we are now going to illuminate.\n\n---\n\n## **Automatism: A Survival Strategy**\n\nEvery automatic pattern has a logic:  \nIt protected us once.\n\n- The perfectionist (Type 1) corrected to avoid criticism.\n    \n- The helper (Type 2) made themselves indispensable to feel loved.\n    \n- The achiever (Type 3) performed to avoid rejection.\n    \n\nThese strategies worked—they were vital in childhood.  \nBut in adulthood, they become rigid, mechanical, outdated.  \nThey respond to a past that no longer exists.\n\n---\n\n## **The Ego as a Filter**\n\nThe ego works like an invisible pair of glasses.  \nIt colors reality according to its core fear:\n\n- Type 1 sees imperfection everywhere.\n    \n- Type 6 sees potential threats everywhere.\n    \n- Type 7 sees opportunities to escape boredom everywhere.\n    \n\nThis filter doesn’t feel like a filter—it feels like _the truth._  \nThat is what makes it so hard to notice.\n\nLighting up the invisible means acknowledging that what seems objectively true is often just a projection of the ego.\n\n---\n\n## **Pain and Suffering: Two Different Realities**\n\nA key teaching is distinguishing between pain and suffering.\n\n- **Pain** is inevitable: loss, separation, failure.\n    \n- **Suffering** arises from our automatic resistance to pain.\n    \n\nExample: a project fails.  \nPain is the disappointment.  \nSuffering is the story we tell ourselves:  \n“I’m useless, this always happens, I must start something new quickly to forget.”\n\nThe automatic pattern turns a limited event into a spiral of suffering.\n\nBecoming aware of this mechanism already weakens its power.\n\n---\n\n## **A Moment of Truth**\n\nI remember a day, after a heated meeting, when a wave of anger rose in me.  \nMy reflex would have been to send a sharp email, to regain control.  \nBut by pausing for a moment, I saw something else: my fear of being humiliated.  \nBehind my anger was a vulnerability I didn’t want to feel.\n\nThat clarity changed my response: instead of attacking, I calmly named my feelings.  \nThe situation softened.  \nIt wasn’t easy—but it was the first time I felt the freedom of a real choice.\n\n### **Practical Exercise**\n\nFor one week, choose three situations in which you felt discomfort (anger, fear, avoidance, rigidity). For each one:\n\n1. **Write down the visible automatic reaction**  \n    (e.g., “I interrupted to regain control.”)\n    \n2. **Ask yourself:** _“What was I trying not to feel?”_  \n    (e.g., fear of losing my place, fear of being insignificant.)\n    \n3. **Take 10 minutes to breathe and simply welcome this avoided emotion**, without escaping it.\n    \n\nThe goal is not to solve it right away, but to **see it**.  \nWhat was invisible becomes an object of awareness.\n\nBringing the invisible to light means accepting to look beneath the surface.  \nIt’s not comfortable, but it is the necessary passage for our compulsions to stop secretly running our lives.\n\nIn the next section, we will explore how to turn these insights into concrete experiments, and how to connect your automatic reactions back to their origin: **the deeper needs they were trying to protect.**\n\n---\n\n# **Experimenting and Understanding the “Why”**\n\nObserving automatisms is progress.  \nBut if we stop there, we risk becoming powerless spectators of our own reactions.  \nThe next step is daring to experiment and exploring the deeper meaning of our compulsions.\n\n---\n\n## **Breaking the Auto-Pilot Through Experience**\n\nAwareness doesn’t grow only through reflection.  \nIt grows through experience.\n\nPractically, this means choosing—just once—to do something different.\n\n- The perfectionist leaves a small imperfection on purpose.\n    \n- The helper dares to say no and observes the reaction.\n    \n- The achiever openly shares a failure instead of hiding it.\n    \n- The enthusiast stays with boredom instead of fleeing into a new distraction.\n    \n\nThese modest but concrete experiments create a crack in the compulsion.  \nThey open a space where a new behavior becomes possible.\n\n---\n\n## **Returning to the “Why”**\n\nEvery compulsion has a story.  \nIt once protected something fragile in us:\n\n- The need to be loved.\n    \n- The need to be recognized.\n    \n- The need to feel safe.\n    \n\nIn childhood, these automatisms were intelligent—they helped us adapt.  \nBut in adulthood, they become rigid, inappropriate, even harmful.\n\nUnderstanding this “why”—this root need—is not about blaming parents or the past, but about recognizing that our pattern makes sense.  \nAnd because the need is legitimate, we can find more conscious ways to meet it.\n\n---\n\n## **Healing Rather Than Dampening**\n\nMany personal development approaches focus on mitigation:  \nmanaging stress, breathing to calm anger, planning to avoid procrastination.  \nUseful… but not transformative.\n\nReal healing occurs when we recognize the root fear and face it.  \nWhen we stop running and discover that the fear no longer holds the power it once had over the child we were.\n\nMitigation repairs the surface temporarily; healing frees us deeply.\n\n---\n\n## **Anecdote: Staying With Discomfort**\n\nI recall an evening when I wanted to dive into a new project, knowing it was an escape.  \nI decided to sit still, without opening my computer.  \nAt first, it was unbearable—agitation, the urge to fill the void.  \nThen, after a while, something softened.  \nI felt the sadness behind my automatisms, and I was able to experience it without drowning in it.\n\nThat moment was a turning point:  \nI understood that behind the agitation was simply an emotion I didn’t want to meet.\n\n---\n\n## **Practical Exercise**\n\n1. Choose one recurring automatic pattern (perfectionism, avoidance, seduction, control, etc.).\n    \n2. For one week, decide to suspend it just once per day:\n    \n    - Leaving a task unfinished.\n        \n    - Saying “no” to a request.\n        \n    - Not launching a new idea.\n        \n3. Observe what it triggers in you: fear, anger, sadness, emptiness.\n    \n4. Write in your journal:  \n    **“This automatism serves to… but today I can also…”**\n    \n\nThis exercise connects observation to meaning—and meaning to new freedom.\n\nExperimenting and understanding the why unites two movements:  \naction and depth.  \nOne without the other is incomplete.  \nExperience without meaning remains superficial.  \nMeaning without experience remains theoretical.  \nTogether, they open the door to real transformation.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll see how these insights and experiments weave into a daily life that becomes less automatic, where inner freedom gradually becomes a habit.\n\n---\n\n# **A Less Automatic Life**\n\nBy this stage, you’ve understood the logic of automatisms, learned to observe them, begun revealing the invisible, and experimented with new ways of acting.  \nOne essential question remains:  \nHow do you make this awareness part of everyday life?  \nHow do you turn occasional insights into a durable way of living?\n\n---\n\n## **From Insight to Integration**\n\nA moment of clarity can change a reaction, but it’s not enough to change a life.  \nAutomatisms will return—inevitably.  \nThey are old, deep, wired into our reflexes.\n\nThe goal isn’t to “eliminate them once and for all,” but to build a habit of awareness.\n\nLike physical training, progress comes through repetition.  \nBy observing, naming, experimenting again and again, the space of freedom expands.  \nWhere yesterday we reacted without choice, today we begin to feel the wave coming… and decide how to surf it.\n\n---\n\n## **Three Concrete Benefits**\n\nWhen awareness becomes a practice, three major changes unfold:\n\n1. **Less self-sabotage:** conflicts, scatter, and rigidity decrease.\n    \n2. **More authentic relationships:** by recognizing our fears and strategies, we become clearer, more honest, more available to others.\n    \n3. **A more stable joy:** no longer fleeting excitement or unreachable perfection, but a quieter presence less dependent on circumstances.\n    \n\nThese benefits do not appear overnight.  \nThey settle gradually—like a silent transformation.\n\n---\n\n## **Missteps Are Part of the Journey**\n\nIt’s important to remember that this process is not linear.  \nThere will be relapses, setbacks, moments when old patterns resurface.  \nThis is normal.\n\nThe key is not to judge these moments, but to see them as invitations to begin again.  \nEvery moment of awareness—even after a “regression”—expands your freedom a little more.\n\n---\n\n## **Projection Exercise**\n\nTake a few minutes and imagine:\n\n- If one year from now your automatisms had 20% less control over your life, what would be different?\n    \n- Which relationships would feel easier?\n    \n- Which projects would be more solid?\n    \n- What inner weight would be lighter?\n    \n\nWrite down your answers.  \nThis simple exercise gives a clear direction to your progress:  \nnot impossible perfection, but tangible, realistic, motivating change.\n\n---\n\n## **A Living Practice**\n\nLiving less under the rule of automatisms is not a static state.  \nIt is a living, breathing practice.  \nEach day, each interaction is an opportunity to see, to choose, to practice.\n\nWith time, awareness becomes like a muscle:  \nthe more it is used, the stronger it grows.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter Conclusion**\n\nMoving from automatism to awareness is not a promise of perfection.  \nIt is an invitation to live more freely, more consciously, more authentically.  \nIt marks the beginning of an inner transformation that also reshapes how we relate to the world.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n\n✔️ Create a more concise version  \n✔️ Create an audiobook-friendly version  \n✔️ Adapt the tone (more spiritual / more scientific / more emotional)\n\nJust tell me!","target":"<### Why Change?\n\nI remember a period when I was juggling three projects at the same time. I was enthusiastic, carried by the energy, convinced that I could handle everything at once. But after a few weeks, things started to unravel: I was doing a thousand things at once, and at the same time, I wasn't really making any progress, and me... I was fleeing my frustration by launching even more exciting new ideas. It wasn't courage, nor even creativity. It was an automatism: an escape from the pain of failure, camouflaged under the appearance of enthusiasm.\n\nThat day, I realized that what I believed to be my freedom was just a gilded prison. My enthusiasm, my creativity, which led me to dispersion and which seemed to be my strength, was actually sabotaging what mattered most to me: depth, confidence, stability. And it was by accepting to sit with my discomfort, instead of running toward the next distraction, that I discovered a calmer, truer joy.\n\nThe Trap of Automatisms\n\nOur automatisms are first and foremost protections.\n\nThey have allowed us to survive, to adapt, to avoid pain.\n\nBut by reacting mechanically over time, we end up exhausting ourselves.\n\n- The perfectionist corrects until exhaustion.\n\n- The helper gives endlessly... and exhausts themselves from not receiving.\n\n- The achiever chains successes... but no longer knows who they are behind their masks.\n\n- The enthusiast multiplies experiences... and can no longer bear silence.\n\nAs long as we remain identified with these mechanisms, we believe \"that's just how I am,\" and that's the risk of personality tests. Justifying our reactions because something confirms that we are like that. But the truth is, we are not our automatisms. They are just a protective layer, an old software.\n\nWhy Make the Effort to Change?\n\nThe question is legitimate: why embark on a path that is sometimes uncomfortable? Why face what we've spent years avoiding? It's much more comfortable to live what we know, even if it's not always ideal.\n\nBecause staying in automatism has a price:\n\n- The price of damaged relationships due to our disproportionate reactions.\n\n- The price of sabotaged projects due to our escapes or rigidities.\n\n- The price of fragile joy, dependent on circumstances.\n\nConversely, choosing to progress means reaping concrete benefits:\n\n- Less sabotage in our lives.\n\n- More inner freedom in the face of triggers.\n\n- Truer relationships, because less conditioned by our fears.\n\n- And above all: a more grounded joy, less dependent on the outside.\n\nI would never have been able to finish writing this book if I had stayed with my compulsions of a 7. Staying focused on a project is the fear of missing out on lots of opportunities. It's also a sabotage to not achieve what truly matters to me, if I look deeply.\n\nChanging isn't about transforming into someone else. It's about rediscovering what we were before the armor of the ego took over everything.\n\nThe Paradox of the Ego\n\nThe ego isn't \"bad.\" It's a survival strategy. It was built to protect us from a fundamental fear: abandonment, failure, rejection, weakness... Whatever it may be. But what saved us yesterday often becomes our prison today.\n\nThe progression that the Enneagram talks about isn't a fight against the ego, but a path to observe it, understand it, and gradually stop confusing it with our deep being. Our deep being has an aspiration to live a fulfilled life; somewhere, our ego, through its desire for protection, also protects us, and prevents us from moving toward fulfillment, so much is it focused on protecting us.\n\nA Hope of Transcendence\n\nThis is where hope lies: our automatisms are not inevitable. They are signals, entry points. Recognizing them is the first step to transforming them into choices. And behind that choice, there is the possibility of a less endured life, more conscious.\n\nWhere I thought I had to run ever faster, I discovered the power of slowing down. Where some believe they must control, they discover the peace of letting go.
