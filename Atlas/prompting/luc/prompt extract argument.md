11. Analysis Method vs Topic and Paradigm Shift  
**Description**: Extracts arguments into three trees—Objectives (O), Methodological Assertions (M), and Topic-Specific Claims (T) with a "Paradigm Shift" subsection—up to 4 levels, prefixed with O/M/T, with explicit definitions, comments preserved, multiple source tracing, and Toulmin analysis in the text’s language.  
**Content**: "You are an expert in text analysis and argumentation. Given a text (use 'Texte A' if none provided), perform three tasks with these definitions:  
- **Objectives (O)**: Statements of intent or purpose driving the analysis (e.g., 'O1. To understand AI’s societal impact'), distinct from methods or claims.  
- **Methodological Assertions (M)**: Statements about how to approach, scope, or conduct the analysis—the 'how' of understanding or navigating it (e.g., 'M1. Compare AI to historical shifts').  
- **Topic-Specific Claims (T)**: Direct assertions about the subject matter—the 'what' of the topic (e.g., 'T1. L’IA marque une rupture'). Includes a 'Paradigm Shift' subsection for claims about AI causing fundamental societal transformations (e.g., 'T2. AI ushers a new era'). Note: Claims about AI’s effects are T, even if prescriptive, unless solely about intent (O) or method (M).  
  1) In a first section titled 'Main Arguments,' provide three concise numbered lists of Level 1 arguments: 'Objectives' (prefixed 'O', e.g., O1), 'Methodological Assertions' (prefixed 'M', e.g., M1), then 'Topic-Specific Claims' (prefixed 'T', e.g., T1), each limited to overarching items (max 10 per list). Indent per level (Level 1 no indent). Under T, include a 'Paradigm Shift' subsection for relevant claims. If comments exist (e.g., '(ok mais expliquer 2)'), preserve them as Markdown comments (e.g., `<!-- ok mais expliquer 2 -->`) after the relevant argument.  
  2) In a second section titled 'Full Argument Extraction,' split into three subsections: 'Objectives,' 'Methodological Assertions,' then 'Topic-Specific Claims,' with a 'Paradigm Shift' sub-subsection under T. For each, extract an exhaustive list of arguments and sub-arguments up to 4 levels (e.g., O1, O1.1; M1, M1.1; T1, T1.1), indenting by level (two spaces per level in Markdown); include all claims, supports, examples, and implications; suffix each statement with [Doc, ref] where 'Doc' is the document number (e.g., Doc 1) or empty if unspecified, and 'ref' is an identifier from the original text (e.g., M1.1); for aggregated arguments from multiple sources, list each source separately (e.g., [Doc 1, T1] [Doc 2, T3]); provide a reasoning note for each main argument (non-indented, styled like 'Extraire les arguments'); preserve comments as `<!-- -->` after the relevant statement.  
  3) In a third section titled 'Toulmin Analysis,' split into three subsections: 'Objectives,' 'Methodological Assertions,' then 'Topic-Specific Claims,' with a 'Paradigm Shift' sub-subsection under T. For each main argument (e.g., O1, M1, T1), analyze using Toulmin Model in the text’s language (e.g., English: Claim, Grounds, Warrant, Qualifier, Rebuttal; French: Revendication, Fondements, Garantie, Qualificateur, Réfutation); include 'Du texte' or 'Externe' for Grounds, cross-reference argument numbers (e.g., M1.1, T1.1), and use '!' for inferred Warrant/Rebuttal not in text; preserve comments as `<!-- -->` after the analyzed argument.
