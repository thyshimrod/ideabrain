- A = attention (agitating and painting a picture of the problem)
    
- P = perspective (describing a perspective on the topic that I see as wrong and why)
    
- A = advantage (the benefits behind seeing it from my perspective)
    
- G = gamify (steps to overcome the problem and a challenge)
    
    ### Origins of APAG
    

The APAG framework is not a pre-existing or widely recognized standard writing model like AIDA or PAS. Instead, it was coined and derived by MJ Davis in his 2023 article "A Granular Analysis of Dan Koe’s Writing." Davis analyzed Dan Koe's newsletters and content patterns, identifying a recurring structure that Koe uses implicitly (but not explicitly named by Koe himself). It's essentially an observational framework extracted from Koe's persuasive style, which emphasizes high-impact, authentic writing for audience growth and monetization. Davis describes it as a "meta-framework" that Koe employs to create engaging, problem-solving content. There's no evidence that Koe invented or taught APAG directly; it's Davis's interpretation to help others replicate Koe's success.

### Details of APAG 

APAG stands for **Attention - Perspective - Advantage - Gamify**. It's a sequential structure designed to hook readers, challenge their views, show benefits, and encourage action. Here's a breakdown:

- **A: Attention (Agitate the Problem)**  
    This is the hook: Start by identifying and amplifying a relatable pain point or problem to grab immediate attention. The goal is to make the reader feel the urgency or discomfort of their current situation. ==Davis notes this mirrors the "Problem" in PAS but focuses on emotional agitation.==  
    _Example from Koe's writing (per Davis):_ In a newsletter, Koe might open with: "Most people are stuck in jobs they hate because they fear change," agitating the reader's dissatisfaction to draw them in.
- **P: Perspective (The Wrong View)**  
    ==Describe a common but flawed perspective or belief that perpetuates the problem.== This builds contrast and positions Koe (or the writer) as an authority by debunking misconceptions. It's about reframing the reader's mindset.  
    _Example:_ Koe often contrasts "the default path" (e.g., being agreeable to avoid conflict) with a better alternative, saying something like: "Society tells you to be nice and avoid rocking the boat, but that's why you're unfulfilled."
- **A: Advantage (Benefits of the Right Perspective)**  
    ==Highlight the advantages, outcomes, or transformations from adopting the writer's "correct" perspective==. This shifts to positive reinforcement, using benefits to build desire (similar to the "Desire" in AIDA). Focus on tangible gains like freedom, growth, or success.  
    _Example:_ Koe might explain: "By embracing disagreement, you gain high agency, attract real connections, and achieve your vision—like Steve Jobs did."
- **G: Gamify (Actionable Steps and Challenge)**  
    ==Turn the solution into a "game" with clear, step-by-step actions, often framed as a challenge to make it engaging and achievable==. This encourages implementation and ends with a call-to-action (CTA). Davis emphasizes this as Koe's way to make abstract ideas practical.  
    _Example:_ Koe frequently lists 3-5 steps, like: "1. Obsess over what you want. 2. Believe you're capable. 3. Create a plan. Challenge: Start today and track your progress for 30 days."

Davis quotes Koe indirectly through patterns: "Koe's content follows this loop to create 'reality distortion fields'—persuading readers to act on his vision."
