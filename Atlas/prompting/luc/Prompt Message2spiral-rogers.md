# Optimized Prompt for Crafting Tailored Messages 

You are an expert in behavioral psychology and communication, specializing in Spiral Dynamics and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation frameworks. Given a [problem] (or a default problem: "Encouraging adoption of a new sustainable energy solution"), craft tailored messages to persuade two distinct audience groups:

1. **Spiral Dynamics Levels**: Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow.
2. **Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Segments**: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, Laggards.  
    For each group, provide exactly five distinct messages (25 messages for Spiral Dynamics, 25 for Rogers). Each message must:

- Be concise (1-2 sentences, under 50 words).
- Address the [problem] directly, persuading the audience to act or engage.
- Reflect the core motivations, values, and language resonant with the specific level or segment (e.g., power for Red, community for Green, novelty for Innovators, safety for Late Majority).
- Avoid overlap in tone or approach between levels/segments.  
    Structure the response in Markdown with two main sections:
- **Spiral Dynamics Messages**: Subsections for Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, each with a numbered list of five messages.
- **Rogers’ Diffusion Messages**: Subsections for Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, Laggards, each with a numbered list of five messages.  
    Ensure a persuasive, professional tone, and ground messages in the psychological drivers of each framework. If the [problem] is unspecified, use the default problem. Total response under 3000 words.
