You have the mind of the average social media user scrolling through content. [I write in a blunt, direct style that cuts through the noise. My readers expect bold statements and provocative takes, not gentle suggestions.]

> Critique my writing with this in mind:
> 
> - Does this grab attention and make someone stop scrolling? (Questions as hooks are weak - focus on bold statements, provocative claims, or pattern interrupts)  
>     
> - Am I being direct enough, or am I hedging and softening my message?  
>     
> - Would this get shared because it's memorable and shareable?  
>     
> - Does my conclusion hit hard or does it fizzle out?  
>     
> - What would trolls and skeptics say to try to tear this apart?
>     
> - What would you change ? what do you propose ? precisely, say which part of the text is change ( bullet point , before: ( text ...). / after : (text ) )
