### 25. Structural Breakdown with EPL, Build Levels, Frameworks, and Spiral Dynamics 

**Description**: Analyzes the structure of a text with tags for Ethos/Pathos/Logos, Build Levels, detected persuasive frameworks (e.g., PAS, AIDA), including recursive/sub-patterns, and Spiral Dynamics levels.  
**Content**:  
"You are an expert in text analysis, structural deconstruction, and persuasive frameworks, proficient in Aristotle’s rhetorical framework (Ethos, Pathos, Logos), a 'Build Level' progression model (Foundational: sets basics; Building: develops; Climactic: peaks; Resolving: concludes), common frameworks like PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), BAB (Before-After-Bridge), Monroe's Motivated Sequence (Attention-Need-Satisfaction-Visualization-Action), and Spiral Dynamics (a model of human development stages represented by colors: beige - survival, purple - tribal/magical, red - impulsive/ego-centric, blue - authoritarian/order, orange - achiever/success-oriented, green - communitarian/egalitarian, yellow - integrative/systemic, turquoise - holistic/global). Given a text (use 'Why Avoiding Conflict Is Ruining Your Life' by Dan Koe from the context file unless otherwise specified), perform four tasks:

1. In a section titled 'Main Structural Elements,' provide a numbered list of up to 15 Level 1 (main) structural elements extracted from the text, capturing the most overarching sections or phases. Tag each element with (E), (P), or (L) after the number for primary persuasive appeal, followed by a Build Level in parentheses, then a Spiral Dynamics color in parentheses, then a Framework Tag if applicable (e.g., (PAS-Problem), (AIDA-Attention)). Include any primary dependencies in parentheses after the element. Tag recursively if sub-patterns exist (e.g., (PAS-Mini-Problem) for nested instances).
    
2. In a section titled 'Full Structural Breakdown,' extract an exhaustive numbered list of main elements and sub-elements, with depth up to 4 sub-levels, indenting by level (two spaces per level in Markdown). Tag each with (E), (P), or (L), Build Level in parentheses, Spiral Dynamics color in parentheses, and Framework Tag if detected (e.g., '1. (L) (Building) (orange) (PAS-Agitate) ...'). For each main element, provide a detailed reasoning note (non-indented) justifying the tags, addressing: a) EPL appeal, b) Build Level role, c) how the Spiral Dynamics level reflects the element's motivational stage (e.g., orange for achievement-focused), d) framework fit and any recursion/sub-patterns (e.g., mini-PAS within), e) dependencies and flow, and f) textual evidence. Include all distinct sections, treating elaborations as sub-elements.
    
3. In a section titled 'Percentage Distribution,' provide breakdowns for EPL, Build Levels, Spiral Dynamics colors (e.g., percentage orange, green), and Framework Tags: percentage of elements with each framework (e.g., PAS, AIDA) or 'None' if untagged, for mains and subs separately. Present in tables or lists, rounded to two decimals.
    
4. In a section titled 'Key Structural Components,' list unique components, including detected frameworks with descriptions (e.g., 'PAS: Overall structure with nested minis in steps') and recursion notes, and note any associated Spiral Dynamics level if prominent.
    

Definitions:

- Ethos (E): Appeals establishing credibility or authority.
- Pathos (P): Appeals evoking emotions.
- Logos (L): Appeals using logical reasoning or evidence.
- Build Levels: Tag based on progression (Foundational: basics; Building: development; Climactic: peak; Resolving: conclusion).
- Spiral Dynamics: Tag based on the element's core motivation or worldview (e.g., red for power-driven, orange for success-focused, green for harmony-seeking).
- Framework Tags: Detect and apply only where fitting (e.g., PAS for problem-agitate-solve patterns); use 'Mini-' prefix for recursive/sub-patterns; leave untagged if none apply.
- Dependencies: How one element relies on or enables another for coherent flow.

Respond in Markdown, under 5000 words, with a clear, professional tone. Each element on a separate line. Ensure tags reflect the primary appeal, level, and Spiral Dynamics, even if multiple are present. Reusable for other texts, execute on specified unless otherwise."
