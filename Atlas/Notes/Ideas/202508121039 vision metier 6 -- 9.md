## 2. Characteristics of a Type 6 Integrating Toward Type 9

We start from the **Type 6** (The Loyalist) base — vigilance, loyalty, need for security, team spirit, capacity for anticipation — and add the acquired qualities of **Type 9** (The Peacemaker) — calm, acceptance, big-picture vision, pacification.

### **When integrated**, the Type 6:
- **Becomes more serene**: less inner tension, more self-confidence, less reactive to perceived threats.
- **Takes a broader perspective**: adopts a global vision, less focused on immediate dangers.
- **Practices acceptance**: recognizes that some uncertainties are inevitable and life cannot be entirely controlled.
- **Promotes peace**: acts as a natural mediator, capable of defusing conflicts rather than anxiously anticipating them.
- **Remains loyal and committed**, but with less anxious attachment — offers presence in a more relaxed way.
- **Develops deep listening**: picks up on unspoken cues and subtle signals, while staying calm.
- **Keeps anticipation skills** but uses them to build collective, calming solutions.
- **Emphasizes relational harmony** rather than just risk prevention.
- **Strengthens psychological safety** around them: becomes a stabilizing figure for others.
- **Uses humor and gentleness** to lighten situations.

**Summary:** a Type 6 integrated into Type 9 remains reliable and vigilant, but becomes more relaxed, takes more distance, and becomes a peacemaker.
