[nmn nad](<NMN, NAD, NR etc My first try ( Last year) and a question to sanjay :
 - I receceived my NMN and giving it a try .effectively feeling more « energised », without the anxious push i got from cordyceps for instance ( noradrenalin)

 Did I understood well from last session, that you said , that when there is lower energy, there may be some confusion, and that is leading to more in-activity ? ( like a dilemna «  can i make it? « , ( with the energy i got) , is it worth it ?)   Lower energy -%3E confusion -> to get out-> higher energy ( ex : NMN on the physical ) 

- Sanjay : Yes, Luc. When there is low energy, there can be confusion and subtle triggering of the past which can deal with and energy will come back.

 I first tried these : cheaper 20 ish 1/ https://www.amazon.es/gp/f.html?C=3M2WIG6WX58VI&K=361EO91SX23KO&M=urn:rtn:msg:20230419200905151beace92044fe0bc84d2a7a580p0eu&R=38GTQ7EXRTANM&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.amazon.es%2Fabredir%2Fdp%2FB0BLYXT12V%2Fref%3Dpe_27091411_487056151_TE_item&H=AAPUFGZHDEQHZSSGBMXLTBRAEHMA&ref_=pe_27091411_487056151_TE_item 


 2/ then these , reputated the best , but very expensive plus tax etc : 150 ish NAD⁺ Complete - NAD⁺, NMN, & NR (Liposomal) 90 Ct. https://renuebyscience.com/fr/Les-produits/lipo-nad-liposomal-complet-en-poudre/ | ----- | 


 And now these : cheaper , and full of other things i then dont have to add to my daily stack : NAD+ Liposomal Anti Aging Supplement Complex AEON with Nicotinamide DUO™ × 1 https://perpetua.life/products/aeon-anti-aging-11-complex-supplement-with-nicotinamide-fisetin-quercetin-resveratrol-astragalus-and-more I would say : Try 1/ then 3/ if you wish to go on
