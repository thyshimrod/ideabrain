# Using Type 7 Wings as Growth Stretches

* First, adopt Type 6’s tendency to pay more attention to the risks you run when you don’t follow through on implementing plans or projects, or double-check all the details. Get in touch with any fears or concerns that will help you ensure that everything you do gets done well. Consider whether you engage in relationships in superficial ways and deepen your commitments based  on really feeling a desire to be responsible and demonstrate loyalty. Face difficult conversations you may need to have and commit to fixing any problems you have avoided addressing. Take responsibility for assuring that problems get solved.
* Then integrate Type 8’s ability to make clearer decisions about what to prioritize. Stop participating in activities that don’t really add anything meaningful to your life or that don’t advance your progress toward your goals. Look at existing challenges that need to be met, rather than new opportunities to explore. Take action to solve problems in a direct way, even when it proves difficult. Be practical and finish things you need to finish. Act to implement one or two good ideas rather than generating many. Do the most important thing first, not the thing you like the most. Be clear, direct, decisive, and assertive in your communication. Practice taking charge and moving straight ahead rather than getting distracted.

# Facing the Shadow

Meeting the Type 7 Shadow
If you identify as a Type 7, here are some actions you can take to bring to the surface, become more aware of, and start working to counteract the key unconscious patterns, blind spots, and pain points of the type:
* Look at your cravings to see what triggers them. While everyone needs to experience pleasure, being dependent on feeling good may fuel addictive behavior that stems from unacknowledged fear or sadness.
* Observe how engaging people with stories and other forms of intellectual seduction may help you rationalize problems, deflect discomfort, or maintain freedom. 
* Examine whether your style of charming and disarming people who might have problems with you may work sometimes, but may also deepen discord in the long run. 
* Confront your “inner pessimist.” Although you appear optimistic, you need to see and own the part of you that believes that, if you don’t relentlessly stay positive (“look on the bright side”), you will be trapped in a bad feeling forever. 
* Notice whether your belief that your pain won’t go away if you allow yourself to feel it is limiting you without you realizing it.
* Ask yourself if, when you become uninterested in something, the quality of what you do goes down.
* Recognize how keeping your options open until the last minute leads to letting people down when you abruptly back out of commitments and promises. 
* Own that your drive for instant gratification may come from anxiety related to facing pain or limitation.
* Examine your tendency to be self-referencing—to put your attention primarily on what you want and need. Notice how this can lead to a lack of empathy or support for others.


# The Type 7 Blind Spots

## Avoiding Problems
Allocate some time every day to work on problematic issues, no matter how it feels. Make sure you do all you need to do. When you finish, do something fun, so that your ego allows you to do this again.
* With a psychotherapist or close friend you trust, talk about all the ways you have been distracting yourself from problems throughout your life. Notice if you resist being fully honest, make excuses, or whitewash things. 
* Notice when you distract yourself from facing something difficult or something you label as “boring” and ask yourself why. What do you fear will happen if you deal with the issue? How will you benefit from dealing with it now? What good things will you feel after having dealt with it? 
* Become aware of any thoughts or feelings that convince you your problems look worse than they actually are. On the other hand, do you persist in claiming that your problems don’t exist?
* Admit that you need help to focus on specific difficult issues and ask people to coach you through dealing with these problems. 
* Reflect more deeply on the emotions you avoid when you evade challenging situations.

## Avoiding Accountability

* Recognize your underlying motives every time you try to minimize your responsibility by making something relative or somehow “not so bad.” 
* Become aware of the positive story you try to defend when you don’t hold yourself accountable. Ask yourself if it masks an unacknowledged fear of failure.
* Acknowledge the hard time you have facing some of your adult responsibilities because they seem tedious or boring or limiting. You may have a bit of a “Peter Pan” complex that makes you play the role of the “eternal child.”
* Be aware of any desire to share responsibility with others more than (perhaps) is warranted.
* Ask others to point out when you rationalize—or find good reasons— to avoid accountability.
* Notice and tolerate the feelings that arise when they help you to face reality. 
* Admit to yourself and to someone you trust that you have a natural tendency to run away from taking full responsibility for things that don’t work out well. When you succeed in holding yourself accountable, notice how this can also feel good.

## Disregarding Pain and Negative Data

Notice how hard it is to look at and talk about anything that seems negative. What stands in your way of accepting what’s true when it doesn’t feel good?

* Become more aware of how focusing only on good feelings acts as a defense against experiencing painful feelings. Think deeply about all the reasons you distract yourself from any kind of difficult emotions. 
* Notice any situations in your life that have worsened as a result of your resistance to acknowledging fear, anxiety, sadness, or pain. Own that your dislike of anything you identify as “boring” or uncomfortable operates as a way to avoid negative emotions.
* Observe your tendency to see only the good side of things. Notice if you do this even more if you sense that some negative data exists somewhere. 
* Explore your tendency to focus on how to improve things without truly facing what isn’t working.
* Recognize when you find it difficult to feel disappointed when situations don’t turn out the way you wanted them to—and then consciously allow yourself to feel the disappointment.

# The Type 7 Subtypes

## Self-Preservation 7 Subtype
This subtype is pragmatic and excels at making alliances. They create a family-like network through which they can get their needs met. They tend to be alert and open to opportunities for pleasure and for making a good deal. They are cheerful, talkative, and hedonistic. They are the most self-referencing subtype and their empathy tends to be the most underdeveloped.

## Social 7 Subtype
This subtype cares about others and sacrifices for other people in selfless ways, as they tend to want to be careful not to exploit opportunities for their own advantage. Their gluttony gets directed toward a wish to be good and pure, and so they often focus on doing some kind of work aimed at reducing suffering in the world. They are drawn to professions in which they alleviate pain. They pay attention to the larger collective and tend to hold a Utopian vision of the world—they express enthusiasm for envisioning a better world.

## Sexual (One-to-One) 7 Subtype
This subtype is idealistic and dreams of a better world. They may have trouble being in touch with ordinary reality as they live more from their imagination of how they would like things to be. They tend to be very happy and excessively enthusiastic—they see the world as better than it actually is. They have a tendency to fantasize and be somewhat naive, perceiving the world through “rose-colored glasses.” They have a tendency to be fascinated with ideas and people. They may
seem gullible and susceptible to other people’s opinions, interests, and energy

# The Type 7 Subtype Shadows

## Self-Preservation 7 Shadow
If this is your subtype, you will need to observe yourself to see if you take opportunistic stances and sometimes take advantage of people. You may tend to use others for your own benefit, or disregard their needs and feelings. As you tend to be very self-referencing and self-interested, this can lead you to put yourself first in a way that you may not own and that can be selfish. You may value your head more than your heart much of the time, and may not be very in touch with your
emotions or very sensitive to the emotions of others. To grow, you will need to become more aware of how much you act from self-interest.

## Social 7 Shadow
If this is your subtype, you tend to present yourself as a good, humble, and self-sacrificing person, but this can hide an unconscious superiority complex that makes you feel better (and more unselfish) than others. You dedicate yourself to causes that address others’ pain, but this may actually serve your need to avoid your own unacknowledged pain while proving your goodness. You help others in exaggerated ways, but this may not always be completely altruistic. It may also be motivated by your intolerance of pain generally and your need to be good—or to be seen as good (and not selfish or self-interested). You need to learn to be less available to help others, to address your own needs and desires, and to go against your taboo on selfishness.

## Sexual (One-to-One) 7 Shadow
If this is your subtype, your idealism, enthusiasm, and optimism may lead you to disconnect from reality in ways you don’t see. You may be blind to things you do that don’t serve you (or others). Your creativity may come with a tendency to fantasize, which can lead to being excessively positive. You tend to display the most intolerance for dealing with pain and negative data. Your gluttony for seeing the positive in everything may mean that other people easily influence you. You
may tend to avoid dealing with reality in ways that cause real harm.

# The Type 7 Paradox

* Notice when you get anxious and want to stop an activity you judge as “boring.” Take some conscious breaths, sense your body, and calm your heart. If you stay present, your experience will be neutral, not boring.
* When you get excited about something “amazing,” try to balance enthusiasm with stillness. Excitement triggers or results from glutt ony.
 * Identify activities that help you concentrate. Do more of whatever helps you focus and less of whatever leads you to distract yourself. 
 * Gradually stop overstimulating yourself with movement, sound, imagination, and other experiences that lead you to speed up and disperse your focus. For you, less is more.
 * Make conscious eff orts to recall moments in your life that have been hard. Stay in touch with them for longer periods of time, without redefi ning them as easier or lighter than they actually were.
 * List all the activities and plans that remain unfi nished in your life. Courageously decide to complete one of these today or in the next week.

# Using Type 7 Arrow Lines for Growth

* First, adopt Type 5’s practice of paying more attention to whatever happens inside you. Balance your tendency to innovate with a focus on learning about something in greater depth. Counteract your focus on what’s exciting out there in the world by paying more attention to your own inner processes. Practice staying more inside yourself and becoming quieter and more calm. Learn to enjoy concentrating on one specific thing at a time. Specialize in something rather than being a “jack of all trades and master of none.” Develop more consistency, thoughtfulness, and objectivity in what you do.
* Then work to integrate Type 1’s ability to be more grounded in the body in the present moment. Enjoy a new capacity to stay focused on one important priority. Be more intentional and selective about what needs to be done, instead of being carried along with the excitement of the moment. Focus on fewer projects and follow through on them to the end. Enhance your ability to concentrate and your sense of responsibility. Focus on delivering things on time with a high level of quality. Develop your ability to be more practical and process-oriented when it comes to implementing your ideas.

# Embracing the High Side

In fact, when 7s do the work to get to this stage of their growth path, they see that life works in magical ways to bring us our most important opportunities for growth, even when this means facing challenges and difficulties. When they grow beyond their zombie mode, this type sees the challenges that arise in life as learning opportunities that can lead to a deeper kind of joy and fulfillment that is sometimes hard-won

If you identify as a Type 7, here are some things you can do at this stage of your journey that you couldn’t have done before—and what you can continue to work on:
* Focus on the one priority that will make the biggest difference and be happy about it.
* Pay less attention to things you may be missing and value your present encounters more.
* Let go of your “monkey mind” and feel more balanced and relaxed. 
* Finish projects and appreciate the benefits of completion and fulfillment.
* Be less anxious about imagining all the possibilities and pleasures in life and enjoy one experience at a time more fully—all the way through to the end.
* Build better relationships by having greater empathy for others.
* Welcome all your emotions without fear, knowing they are just passing through. Feel your emotions all the way through to completion, confident in your ability to experience them and move through them. 
* Balance the good with the bad, and acknowledge what they both have
to teach you.

# The Type 7 Virtue

If you are a Type 7, here are some steps you can take to move you forward on your path toward a greater realization of the virtue of sobriety:
* Stay present to one thing at a time.
* Adopt a meditation practice.
* Open your heart to whatever emotions arise. Address suffering by engaging with it rather than escaping from it. 
* Become more strongly rooted in your body and less anxiously active. 
* Hold a mature perspective; know it pays to postpone short-term gratification for the sake of fulfilling meaningful commitments.
* Orient yourself to the deeper truth of lived experience rather than just the pursuit of enjoyment. 
* Let go of “the pleasure principle” in favor of what brings real satisfaction in the long term.
* Talk less and do fewer things that distract you and others from being present.
* Exchange your desires for needs that are more real, relevant, and long-lasting. 
* perate from a sense of reason, emotional steadiness, and grounded self-confidence, rather than being swept away by impulses and fantasies.
