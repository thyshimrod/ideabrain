### Key Structural Components
- **PAS**: Overall structure with nested minis in steps (e.g., 2.1 PAS-Mini-Agitate), reflecting problem-solution flow.
- **AIDA**: Used in attention-grabbing and action phases (e.g., 3 AIDA-Attention, 5 AIDA-Action), with recursive interest builds.
- **APAG**: Integrated for perspective and gamification (e.g., 7 APAG-Perspective), guiding reader engagement.
- **Recursions**: Mini-PAS and AIDA sub-patterns enhance depth (e.g., 4.1 PAS-Mini-Solve).
- **Spiral Dynamics**: Prominent levels (green, orange, yellow) reflect community, success, and integration themes.
