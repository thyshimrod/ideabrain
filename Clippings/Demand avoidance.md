A persistent and marked resistance to demands is a characteristic experienced by and observed in some autistic people. It can impact essential needs like eating and sleeping, and expectations such as going to school or work, and has implications for diagnosis and support. People with lived experience have suggested strategies for self-management and support.

## What is demand avoidance?

Everyone experiences ‘demand avoidance’ (resistance to doing something that is requested or expected of you) sometimes. However, here we use demand avoidance to mean the characteristic of a persistent and marked resistance to 'the demands of everyday life’, which may include essential demands such as eating and sleeping as well as expected demands such as going to school or work.

Although demand avoidance is widely acknowledged as a characteristic experienced by and observed in some autistic people (and potentially other neurodivergent, but not autistic, people), there is very little research into it and the research that does exist is generally of a low quality.

Because of this, many aspects of demand avoidance – including how it is best defined and identified; how common it is; why it happens; and support strategies for someone experiencing it – are under-researched and often contested. On this page we aim to present a range of views and the best available information gathered from lived experience, research and professional practice (you can read more about how these pages are developed on our [Advice and guidance content process](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/content-process) page).

**Types of demand**

Below are some examples of the ‘demands of everyday life’ that a person experiencing demand avoidance may resist (note that the demand does not need to be something unpleasant to trigger distress):

- a direct demand (an instruction, such as ‘brush your teeth’, ‘put your coat on’ or ‘complete your tax return’)
- an internal demand (for example willing yourself to do something, or bodily needs such as hunger or needing the toilet)
- an indirect or implied demand (including any expectation, such as a question that requires an answer, food in front of you that you are expected to eat, or a bill arriving that needs to be paid).

**Forms of resistance**

Noted forms of resistance include:

- giving excuses (which may be fanciful – for example, 'I can't because I am a tractor and tractors don't have hands' or 'I can't because my legs are broken' (though they aren't))
- distraction or diversion (such as giving affection or compliments; changing the subject; making noise that makes further discussion difficult; or creating a situation that needs more immediate attention, for example, by knocking something over)
- point blank refusal (saying "No" and not entering into negotiation; physically resisting)
- passivity/withdrawal (becoming floppy; curling up into a ball; not responding; walking/running away; withdrawing into fantasy)
- aggression (usually as a last resort, when other forms of resistance have failed. For example, pushing someone or throwing something away; hitting or kicking; biting. Aggression may be a form of resistance, but it may also be a panic response to overwhelming anxiety.)

The overwhelming anxiety of realising that a demand cannot be avoided, or that these forms of resistance have been exhausted, may result in meltdown or panic, potentially including aggression. These states are usually out of the person's control.

**Examples of demand avoidance from lived experience**

Because everyone experiences demand avoidance sometimes, it can be difficult to understand what is meant by a marked and persistent resistance to demands. The following real-life examples are from people’s lived experience and give a good illustration of the meaning and impact this characteristic can have.

Please note that many of the quoted people identify with the proposed condition Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), of which demand avoidance is the central characteristic. This is discussed in more detail further down the page.

“With my PDA kids, they will avoid things they want to do, if I put their favourite food in front of them they’ll have a meltdown because it ‘wasn’t what they asked for’ or they ‘can’t eat it right now’ or I ‘used the wrong colour bowl’. They want to eat it, they just can’t because it’s a demand. … Many PDAers will come out with reasons for why they cannot do something, often fantasy reasons such as saying they cannot get dressed because they are a dog and dogs don’t wear clothes, or they can’t get dressed because their legs are on fire.”

– Riko Ryuki, [Autistic demand avoidance – an example](https://dragonriko.wordpress.com/2022/10/26/autistic-demand-avoidance-an-example/)

“Demands, particularly external ones, cause me great distress, even if I want to participate or do the action, every suggestion always has a knee-jerk ‘NO!’ response.”

– Kyra Chambers, [For the love of roleplay](https://vocal.media/humans/for-the-love-of-roleplay)

"Examples could include things like: there was something I was going to do, I planned to do, but before I could actually do it, before I had a chance to do it, someone intervened and asked me to do it – and now, I can't do it. … When I say unable, I do not mean 'don't feel like it', … it's an inability."

– Orion Kelly, [Understanding demand avoidance in autism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lInOsxe2Lo4)

“The single most important thing to a PDA individual is their autonomy; to decide things for themselves and be in complete control of what they do and where they are going. We need equality and fairness; it doesn’t make sense in our brains why everyone isn’t on the same level and to be treated and respected equally. This is often a cause of why we buck against authority figures so much, aside from rejecting anyone who tries to tell us what to do!”

– Jo Richardson, [Different not deficient](https://www.differentnotdeficient.co.uk/post/what-is-pda)

“PDAers are masters of demand avoidance in that they are skilled at making excuses or using distraction techniques to avoid any demands put on them. These techniques can include; procrastination, manipulation, negotiation, hurting themselves so they are unable to complete the request, withdrawing into a fantasy world or physically attacking the person making the request or demand. The violence is often used when their anxiety levels are high and they don’t think that any other form of avoidance will work or that their emotions and anxiety peak and they have an explosive meltdown.”

– Jo Richardson, [Different not deficient](https://www.differentnotdeficient.co.uk/post/what-is-pda)

“PDAers' demand avoidance can apply to every single instance where they perceive a demand; this could be getting up in the morning, eating, drinking, going to see a movie that they have been really looking forward to going to, playing with a new toy etc. It is uncontrollable and all encompassing.”

– Jo Richardson, [Different not deficient](https://www.differentnotdeficient.co.uk/post/what-is-pda)

"If I put something in my diary, as soon as it's in black and white and it's a demand, I feel anxiety. I feel anxiety as I put it in my diary; I feel anxiety in the lead up; I feel anxiety on the morning when I wake up and that thing is in my diary. It makes me experience demand avoidance, even if it's something I wanted to do. Ditto putting a task on my 'To do' list – as soon as the demand is on my 'To do' list, it's a demand and it causes anxiety."

– Purple Ella, [Demand avoidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUeeyivGuW8)

“Typical or traditional parenting strategies involve showing the child that the parent is in control. With PDA, the child needs to feel like they are the ones in control – which involves some pretty exhausting forward planning and sometimes quick thinking. The truth is that the more you try and make a PDA child fit into the system, by following typical parenting or education strategies, the more likely they are to feel forced into behaviour which challenges.”

– Steph Curtis, [Challenging behaviour and PDA](https://www.stephstwogirls.co.uk/2016/10/challenging-behaviour-and-pda.html)

“PDAers will sometimes go to extreme lengths to avoid everyday demands. They may be unable to agree to go and do their favourite activity even if they would actually really enjoy it, if a multitude of other demands have been placed on them that day and they no longer feel in control.”

– Steph Curtis, [What is PDA?](https://www.stephstwogirls.co.uk/2018/04/does-my-child-have-pathological-demand.html)

**Relationship to autism and other neurodivergences**

Demand avoidance is most often conceived as a characteristic experienced by and/or observed in autistic people. It has been characterised as the key characteristic of a proposed condition or profile of autism called Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), although this is a controversial label that is not recognised clinically (meaning it is not included in medical manuals) and is contested within the autism community.

Although advocates of PDA most often think of it as a potential profile of autism, some have suggested PDA may be a distinct neurotype or neurological difference, not connected to autism or the conditions listed below.

Besides autism, it has been suggested that the presentation of a persistent and marked resistance to demands may be connected with other conditions, including:

- complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD)
- attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).

**Context about demand avoidance and our understanding of autism**

It is important to note that when demand avoidance was first described, some of the behaviours observed were considered uncommon in autistic people. However, as our understanding of autism as a spectrum condition has developed, a number of these behaviours are now understood to be more common.

For example, when demand avoidance was first described, it was thought that autistic people were largely not capable of employing some of the creative and socially sophisticated strategies listed above as ‘Forms of resistance’. Our current understanding of the autism spectrum acknowledges that many autistic people are indeed capable of these things.

This context is important when trying to understand the history of and debate around the label Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), which was proposed as a way to describe people experiencing demand avoidance alongside a group of behaviours that were then thought to be uncommon in autistic people (and therefore necessitated a new label, it was argued).

Because almost all research about demand avoidance has been carried out as part of attempts to validate PDA as a distinct profile or condition, it is difficult to separate what we know about the characteristic of demand avoidance from the proposed group of traits known as PDA. This is explored in more detail in the following section.

## The history of and debate about the PDA label

**The history of PDA**

Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) is a term originally developed by the British psychologist Elisabeth Newson in the 1980s and first used in a published research paper by Newson in 2003. It was used to describe a group of children who did not fit into the stereotypical presentation of autism recognised at that time but who shared certain characteristics with each other, the key one being a persistent and marked resistance to demands.

Newson believed this presentation justified a distinct identification (rather than being described generically as ‘Atypical autism’ or ‘Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified’ (PDD-NOS), which were diagnostic labels used at that time) and a list of key features for PDA was created. Some variations of this list have been suggested by researchers and practitioners, though the descriptions have remained broadly the same.

Please note that the following proposed characteristics have historically been described using language associated with the deficit model (of autism), which many people consider inaccurate and offensive; the language below represents a sanitised version, but this should not be considered an endorsement.

The proposed core characteristics most commonly cited are:

- resisting and avoiding the ‘ordinary demands of life’
- using social strategies as forms of resistance – for example, distraction, giving excuses

Other proposed characteristics cited include:

- appearing sociable, but experiencing differences in social understanding (such as recognising hierarchies)
- experiencing intense mood swings and impulsivity
- appearing comfortable in role play and pretence
- displaying dedicated and focused interests, often focused on other people.

Although demand avoidance, including the use of social strategies to avoid demands, is widely acknowledged as a characteristic reported by and observed in some people, no research has found strong evidence for the group of traits proposed for PDA or tested the validity or usefulness of Newson’s theory in clinical practice (the work of healthcare professionals).

PDA is not clinically recognised (it does not appear in the international medical manual, the ICD, nor in the American medical manual, the DSM), which means you cannot receive a standalone diagnosis of PDA. There is debate around how the characteristic of a persistent and marked resistance to demands relates to autism (and other conditions) and whether its grouping with other traits as ‘PDA’ is helpful. For more information about this, see the following subsection ‘Debate about PDA’.

Although it is not possible to receive a diagnosis of PDA, some people have a diagnosis of autism with a 'demand avoidant profile’ or a ‘PDA profile’ noted, and others self-identify with the PDA label. ‘PDAer’ is how many of these people prefer to be referred to. Some object to the use of the word ‘pathological’ in the term ‘Pathological Demand Avoidance’ and have suggested ‘Persistent Drive for Autonomy’ as an alternative. Others think the use of the word ‘pathological’ is appropriate because they find these characteristics ‘all-consuming’.

**Debate about PDA**

There are stark disagreements within the autism community (which includes autistic people, their families and allies, autism researchers, health care professionals, education professionals and more) about the validity and usefulness of the concept of PDA. One point on which there is broad agreement is that more and better research is required.

***Criticism***

Some critics note that there is not enough research evidence to confirm PDA as a separate condition to autism and argue that:

- the complex characteristics can instead be understood by considering the individual’s social, sensory and cognitive sensitivities, any co-occurring conditions and whether their environment is suited to their needs
- the label is unhelpful as it implies the issues are within the person and not created by the above factors, which can be addressed.

It has also been argued that the PDA label represents an unnecessary pathologising of differences in autistic people when:

- they act outside of social norms in attempt to gain autonomy (control over their lives)
- they adopt coping mechanisms or attempt to reduce anxiety associated with social norms or assert self-agency (their desire to make their own decisions.)

It has further been argued that PDA-related products, such as training and conferences, have been promoted to parents and that this creates a looping effect where parents or individuals unintentionally consider behaviour selectively to conform to the proposed traits, re-enforcing their belief in the proposed condition.

***Counter-criticism***

Some of the criticisms listed above have been counter-criticised by people who identify with PDA. They argue that the critics do not have lived experience of these issues and that the views of people with lived experience are being invalidated, or that they are being othered and/or patronised, by these arguments.

***National Autistic Society involvement***

The National Autistic Society has historically engaged with the concept of PDA through website content, training, conference events and other activities. This has created a belief that the National Autistic Society accepts the concept of PDA, and its relationship to autism, to an extent that goes beyond the evidence, which has been referenced in the debate about PDA. We have reviewed our content and approach to be in line with the evidence.

## Identification and assessment of demand avoidance

It is best practice for an autism assessment to identify and record a person’s unique strengths and challenges and so demand-avoidant characteristics or a strong need for personal autonomy must be recorded, with or without the use of any particular terminology such as PDA.

A thorough autism assessment should cover a person's full neurodevelopmental profile, including:

- gathering information about all characteristics, including demand avoidance
- observation of environmental influence on a person’s characteristics.

To support all autistic (or neurodivergent) people, whatever their strengths and challenges may be, there must be:

- good understanding/recognition of neurodivergence (including of complex needs) by health care professionals
- a comprehensive assessment (including external/environmental factors)
- support personalised to align with the person’s strengths and needs.

Although the concept of PDA is not clinically recognised and so it is not possible to receive a standalone diagnosis of PDA, some people are diagnosed as autistic with a ‘PDA profile’ (or similar). However, the usage of this language in an autism diagnosis is not standardised; there is no standard assessment for PDA and usage of this terminology depends on whether the clinicians, practitioners or commissioners in your local area accept it.

Note that many autistic people use social strategies and can have dedicated and intense interests that may be focused on people (these traits may be more common in autistic women and girls, for example), so the presence of these traits is not a reason to discount an autism diagnosis.

## How common is demand avoidance?

We don’t know. Because demand avoidance is currently understood as one characteristic in a person’s neurodevelopmental profile and is neither a diagnosable standalone condition nor is there a standardised assessment for the characteristic, there are no data to reliably indicate how common it may be. It is hard to draw conclusions from the limited and often low-quality research that exists.

## Why does demand avoidance happen?

Evidence suggests that persistent and marked demand avoidance demonstrates an intense need for control. However, this is not well understood and more research is needed.

Some (low quality) research highlights a relationship between this characteristic and the presence of both:

- anxiety, and
- intolerance of uncertainty (needing to know what is going to happen in order to feel calm).

Demand avoidance may be driven by these factors, both of which are common in autistic people. Alternatively, some people with lived experience of demand avoidance have suggested anxiety may be the effect (not cause) of perceived threats (demands) to autonomy and control.

## Impact

Evidence suggests that demand avoidance can impact those experiencing it in a variety of ways, including:

- difficulty getting to sleep, staying asleep and getting up
- short and long-term effects from anxiety and associated symptoms
- difficulty with self-care tasks such as personal hygiene, eating and household chores
- experiencing panic attacks, intense emotional distress and/or difficulty regulating emotion
- difficulties in friendships or other social relationships
- inability to attend education or employment due to distress and/or burnout, which may result in exclusion or termination.

**Impact on parents and carers**

The parents/carers of people experiencing demand avoidance may experience impacts including:

- distress from witnessing their child / the person they are caring for in extreme distress
- challenges and exhaustion from trying to find effective ways to reduce, disguise or remove demands and support the person
- stress and frustration from trying to access or implement appropriate support in areas such as diagnosis, education, mental health and social care.

## Support strategies

It is important that people experiencing persistent and marked demand avoidance are recognised and supported using strategies and approaches personalised to their specific strengths and needs.

Research suggests that the understanding and acceptance of demand avoidant behaviour is fundamental to accessing the right support.

There is limited research on support strategies; however, general advice from personal accounts and professional resources includes:

- reducing and/or removing demands, where at all possible
- a collaborative approach that flattens hierarchies (for example, between parent and child or manager and employee) to work with them rather than ordering them around
- indirect communication styles (not making demands directly)
- avoid potential stressors such as eye contact, touch and confrontational postures/physical stances
- remove any spectators to a distressing situation (by asking people to give the distressed person space or by moving the person to a quiet space if possible)
- a coordinated approach to support, with the person, family and professionals (i.e., from education, social care, healthcare, etc) involved.

Sources suggests people experiencing demand avoidance may benefit from:

- identifying and understanding their demand avoidance (and its triggers)
- managing, reducing and disguising demands
- sensory regulation and creating a sensory environment that works for them
- therapy, counselling, mindfulness and meditation.

**National Autistic Society letter to schools and local authorities**

We have prepared a letter for parents and carers of children and young people who experience demand avoidance to send to schools and local authorities in situations where support may be being denied or withdrawn with reference to this characteristic. The letter explains our position on best practice in autism assessments, which must record all of a person’s characteristics, including demand avoidance, and details the school and local authority’s legal duties in providing support that is tailored to an individual’s unique profile and needs.

“I’ve found that by giving myself an ‘out’ then it is much easier to meet demands, because I know I can change my mind whenever I want. I’ll tell myself, ‘You don’t have to if you don’t want to’, this works quite well.”

– Riko Ryuki, [Adult coping strategies](https://dragonriko.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/1537/)

“Have all your bills on Direct Debit payment to avoid the demands of having to pay bills when they arrive. Try and schedule them to come out around the times when you have the most money in your account, such as right after paydays or benefits deposit.”

– Jo Richardson, [15 Life Hacks for PDA](https://neuroclastic.com/15-life-hacks-for-pda-pathological-demand-avoidance/)

“Being actively given freedom and autonomy, through choices, self-direction, autonomous motivation, and respect of competence and consent, can empty the ‘demand cup’ bit by bit, and keep it emptier. Further to this, allowing plenty of demand free time and rest allows the demand cup to naturally empty.”

– Tomlin Wilding, The Demand Cup

“If your child can only go to school today by being a dinosaur, hey, that is okay. If you can only go to the hospital because you are exploring a newly discovered medical facility in space, then brilliant! You have found your way through, in a way that works for you.”

“When others react badly to the PDAers panic or defence reaction that often they have no control over, this can cause damage to their self-esteem, mental health, and emotional wellbeing, as they are being punished for something they had no control over – punished for trying to protect themselves from a perceived threat.”

– Jo Richardson[,](https://www.differentnotdeficient.co.uk/post/so-what-is-pda)[Different not deficient](https://www.differentnotdeficient.co.uk/post/so-what-is-pda)

“Direct demands should be removed from language wherever possible; it is vital to reconsider the words we use to communicate. So no 'need, must, have to' and instead much more of 'may, could, would you like, how about' etc. More of 'I wonder if we might be able to..' or 'I'm not sure how to do this, could you show me?”

– Steph Curtis, [Strategies for PDA](https://www.stephstwogirls.co.uk/2016/12/strategies-for-pda-pathological-demand.html)

“As we shift our perspective to that of compassion and empathy and away from our own parental control, enforcement of rules and discipline something amazing will begin to happen. Your relationship will begin to change. Your child will start to trust you as an emotionally safe space. They will begin to see, feel and accept that you are on their side.”

“Lowering daily demands will help to reduce anxiety. When you lower the demands you have placed on your child you are actually offering them autonomy. They need to feel as if they have control over their life and the environment they live in.”
